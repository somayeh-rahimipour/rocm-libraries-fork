# GDN/KDA Host Tools: Driver, Benchmark, and Tuning

This directory contains the host-side tools for the shared gfx950 GDN/KDA
single-token decode emitter. The device-code emitter lives at
[`library/kernels/gfx950/gdn_decode.py`](../../../kernels/gfx950/gdn_decode.py).

**GDN prefill** is driven from
[`library/builders/gfx950/kda/gdn_prefill.py`](../../kda/gdn_prefill.py) and runs
the shared KDA chunkwise kernels in `gate_kind="gdn"` mode, so its tools live in
the `kda/` directory rather than here. Its commands are in [Prefill](#prefill)
below.

Start with [`ALGORITHM.md`](ALGORITHM.md) for the equations, gate-kind
difference, and GPU thread mapping. Use this page to run, check, benchmark, or
retune either decode mode or the GDN prefill path.

## Environment

Run from `dnn-providers/hip-kernel-provider/rocke` with both the library and the
platform Python package on `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/library:$PWD/platform/python${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}"
```

The driver, benchmark, tuning sweep, and numeric tests require:

- ROCm torch with a visible gfx950 GPU;
- a working ROCm comgr library for compiling the emitted LLVM IR;
- the rocKE Python package from `platform/python`.

The spec, dispatch, and golden tests do not need a GPU. The golden test lowers
to LLVM IR but does not invoke comgr.

## Check correctness

Run the default warp-tiled path across several batch sizes:

```bash
python3 library/builders/gfx950/gdn/gdn_decode.py \
  --batches 1,16,64,256
```

Example output shape:

```text
kernel: <compiled kernel name>  block=<threads per workgroup>
B=1     grid=<workgroups> out_err=<error> state_err=<error> OK
B=16    grid=<workgroups> out_err=<error> state_err=<error> OK
worst=<largest error> tol=1.0e-02
```

The driver checks **two results**:

- `out_err`: maximum absolute error in this token's output;
- `state_err`: maximum absolute error in the updated recurrent state.

Both must stay below `TOL`. Checking only `out` is insufficient because a bad
state write may not affect the visible output until the next decode step.

Check the simple one-thread-per-row reference body:

```bash
python3 library/builders/gfx950/gdn/gdn_decode.py \
  --batches 1,16 --variant simple
```

Also report wall time from the driver:

```bash
python3 library/builders/gfx950/gdn/gdn_decode.py \
  --batches 1,16 --bench
```

`--no-check` skips the fp32 reference and should be used only for focused
measurement after correctness has already been established.

## Benchmark registered candidates

The GDN benchmark asks the registry for every legal candidate. The default D128
request admits 54 of 180 configured triples and also reports the static
dispatcher-default `auto` selection:

```bash
python3 library/benchmarks/gfx950/gdn/benchmark_gdn_decode.py \
  --batches 1,16,64,256
```

Each row includes a stable `spec_id`
`nw<num_warps>_wtk<warp_threads_k>_bpv<blocks_per_v_dim>`. Dispatcher `auto`
prefers `(2, 16, 8)` whenever legal; measurements never change that choice.

KDA remains a separate work-keyed benchmark:

```bash
python3 -m benchmarks.gfx950.gdn.benchmark_kda_decode \
  --batches 1,8,32,128
```

Both benchmarks print eager and device timing. Eager includes host launch and
synchronisation; device timing uses replayed HIP graphs. Small-batch decode can
be launch-bound, so the two clocks answer different questions. If graph capture
is unavailable, pass `--no-device`.

## Measure candidate tiles

`tune.py` consumes the dispatch candidate set. It correctness-checks every tile
against the FP32 reference, graph-times the correct candidates, then reports
them fastest first:

```bash
python3 library/builders/gfx950/gdn/tune.py \
  --gate-kind gdn --batches 1,16,64,256 --top 5
```

For every GDN cell, it also reports the static dispatcher default, the fastest
legal candidate, the default's rank and time ratio, and a manual
`DEFAULT_TILE` recommendation. Measurements never update the shipped default.

Use KDA's work-keyed study across head geometries when retuning KDA:

```bash
python3 library/builders/gfx950/gdn/tune.py \
  --gate-kind kda --geometries 16/32,8/16,4/8 \
  --batches 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 --top 5
```

GDN measurements are report-only. KDA's measured winners may justify updating
its work-keyed bands; rerun dispatch wiring and numeric tests after doing so.

## Run tests

CPU-only coverage:

```bash
python3 -m pytest \
  library/tests/test_gdn_decode_spec.py \
  library/tests/test_gdn_decode_golden.py \
  library/tests/dispatch/gdn/test_gfx950_registry.py \
  library/tests/dispatch/gdn/test_gfx950_wiring.py \
  library/tests/test_gdn_decode_tune.py \
  -m "not gpu"
```

On-device numeric coverage:

```bash
python3 -m pytest \
  library/tests/test_gdn_decode_gfx950_numeric.py \
  library/tests/test_kda_decode_gfx950_numeric.py \
  -m gpu
```

Re-record the golden LLVM-IR hashes **only when an emitted-code change is
intentional and reviewed**:

```bash
python3 library/tests/test_gdn_decode_golden.py --write
```

Then rerun the golden test. A changed hash means the emitted LLVM IR changed; it
does not by itself say whether the new code is correct.

The project-level check entry point is:

```bash
python3 tools/run_checks.py
```

## Prefill

Prefill is the KDA chunkwise pair in GDN gate mode; the driver and its fp64
oracle are in `kda/`, not this directory.

Check correctness against the oracle:

```bash
python3 library/builders/gfx950/kda/gdn_prefill.py
```

Sweep `value_splits` for a given `batch_heads` band:

```bash
python3 library/benchmarks/gfx950/gdn/sweep_prefill_value_splits.py
```

Tests:

```bash
python3 -m pytest \
  library/tests/dispatch/gdn/test_gfx950_prefill_wiring.py \
  library/tests/test_gdn_prefill_decay_guard.py \
  library/tests/test_kda_chunkwise_spec.py
```

On-device numeric coverage (needs a gfx950 GPU):

```bash
python3 -m pytest library/tests/test_kda_gdn_gfx950_numeric.py
```

## Understand the output

For the warp-tiled path:

```text
grid = batch * num_v_heads * blocks_per_v_dim
```

For the simple reference path, there is no V split:

```text
grid = batch * num_v_heads
```

For GDN, `auto` always uses the static `(2, 16, 8)` registry priority when it
is legal; batch changes the grid but not the tile. KDA alone changes its
work-keyed table choice with `batch * num_v_heads`.

`out_err` and `state_err` are maximum absolute errors against the fp32 reference.
In the current coverage, state error is larger than output error. Both remain
separate because state becomes an input to the next decode step; a correct
current output cannot prove that the next step will read correct state.

## Exit codes

Exit codes differ slightly by command:

| Command | `0` | `1` | `2` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gdn_decode.py` | all requested checks passed, or checks were disabled | at least one checked batch exceeded tolerance | no GPU visible or the fixed spec was rejected |
| `benchmark_gdn_decode.py` | every batch passed correctness and was timed | at least one batch exceeded tolerance | no GPU visible |
| `benchmark_kda_decode.py` | every requested variant/sweep passed correctness and timing | any requested variant/sweep failed or was incomplete | visible HIP device is not gfx950 |
| `tune.py` | every requested cell produced at least one correct, timed tile | some requested cell produced no correct, timeable tile | no GPU visible |

Scripts and CI should check the exit code instead of relying on printed text.

## Common failures

### `no HIP device visible`

The script cannot see a ROCm GPU. Check the job's GPU allocation and
`ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` / `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

### `invalid gdn_decode spec`

The requested dimensions or tiling violate a validator rule. The error message
names the rejected rule. Do not bypass the validator; change the shape or tile.

### Graph capture is unavailable

Use `--no-device` for the benchmark. Eager timing still works. Graph support is
environment-sensitive and does not mean the kernel itself is invalid.

### Golden test reports IR drift

First decide whether the generated code was meant to change. If not, find the
emitter change that caused the drift. If yes, review the new IR and numeric
results, then regenerate with `--write` in the same change.

### Correct output but wrong state

Treat this as a failure. The next decode step reads that state, so checking the
visible output alone is not enough.
