"""CPU-only tests for the gfx942 dense prefill kernel.

Covers the SPEC / VALIDATION / PUBLIC-SURFACE layer and the IR build. No GPU and
no comgr: ``build_attention_dense`` is exercised for its ``KernelDef``, not
compiled or launched. The GPU numeric lane lives in the live benchmark
(``benchmarks/gfx942/attention/prefill/benchmark_dense_prefill_live.py``) --
mirroring the gfx950 precedent, where numeric correctness is a bench gate rather
than a CI pytest.

The central invariant asserted here is the **supports/build contract**:
``supports_attention_dense(spec)[0] is True`` must imply
``build_attention_dense(spec)`` succeeds. A predicate more permissive than the
builder lets dispatch select a spec it cannot build.

NOT WIRED INTO CI: like ``test_attention_dense_golden.py``, this file lives under
``library/tests/``, which ``platform/tests/run_all.py`` does NOT collect (it only
pytests ``platform/tests/``). Run it manually:

    cd rocke/library
    PYTHONPATH=../platform/python:. python -m pytest \
        tests/test_attention_dense_gfx942.py

The gfx942 golden-IR lane is a SEPARATE file, ``test_attention_dense_gfx942_golden.py``
with its own fixture (``tests/golden/attention_dense_gfx942_ir_sha256.json``). The
gfx950 ``test_attention_dense_golden.py`` and its fixture stay gfx942-free, which is
what keeps the gfx950 goldens untouched by anything in this file.

    Until this test existed the True arm of ``if spec.iglp:`` had never been

    user-settable knob, and shipping a never-executed codegen branch as a knob is the
    highest silent-wrong-answer risk in the struct: a knob that quietly emits nothing
    turns a sweep point into a duplicate of the baseline that is reported as a
    measurement of iglp.

    Asserted, in order: the intrinsic reaches the lowered IR as a real ``call``
    (a ``declare`` alone would mean it was emitted and then dropped), it is placed
    exactly once (the runbook §8.4 placement is one directive at the top of the main
    loop, not one per unrolled step), it is ABSENT at the default, and the kernel name
    differs -- without which the name-keyed ``_DENSE_LAUNCHER_CACHE`` would hand the
    iglp build the non-iglp HSACO and the A/B would compare a kernel with itself.
    Run on the cfvst path (fp16 D128, the only one with in-loop ds_write traffic to
    interleave) and on two naive-V configs, since the emission is unconditional.
