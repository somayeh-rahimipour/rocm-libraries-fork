"""CPU-only tests for the gfx942 GQA head-fold in the 4-warp SWA attention kernel.

The head-fold packs the ``num_queries_per_kv`` query heads that share a KV head
into one workgroup's 128-row M-tile so paged K/V is read once per KV head. It
changes device-side index math (grid.x, the 32-token block, and the
``row m -> (token m//4, head m%4)`` map) but is not covered by the representative
golden (that only holds the D256 4wgqa kernel) and the on-GPU fp32 oracle passes
both the folded and unfolded kernels, so nothing else guards it.

These tests run off-GPU (build + emit + dispatch) and are written to FAIL against
the pre-fold kernel:
  * the launch grid must fold over KV heads (grid.x == num_kv_heads, not
    num_query_heads) with 32-token blocks -- pre-fold it is num_query_heads;
  * the builder must emit the distinct ``_4wgqa_fold`` kernel name -- pre-fold
    it is always ``_4wgqa``;
  * the fold predicate must select exactly the D128 / 4:1-GQA / SWA / bf16 /
    block<=32 cohort and reject every other axis.

Every assertion here executes builder/dispatch code, so a fold regression can turn
it red. Pure-arithmetic properties (the ``m//4`` / ``m%4`` bijection) and
pre-existing ``UnifiedAttentionProblem`` invariants (non-divisible head counts
raise) are deliberately NOT asserted here: they hold with or without the fold, so
they cannot fail on a regression. The 4:1 pin the fold relies on is enforced at
build time by the ``GQAG != FOLD_HEADS`` raise in ``attention_tiled_2d.py``.
