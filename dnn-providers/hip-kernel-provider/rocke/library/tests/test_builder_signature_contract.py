# Structural guard for the builder-signature contract (see rocke/AGENTS.md
# "Hard rules" and platform/dsl_docs/development/extending.md 3.6):
#
#     a builder takes the spec and the arch, and nothing else
#
# Concretely: every `build_*` defined under `library/kernels/` must accept
# `arch`, and must accept no parameter other than `spec` and `arch`. An
# arch-specific knob belongs in the spec dataclass -- as a field on an
# arch-specific subclass if it only applies to one arch -- never as a third
# builder parameter.
#
# Why this is worth a test rather than a convention:
#
# A builder that grows an extra parameter still works perfectly for everyone
# calling it by hand. It only breaks the machinery that has to describe a
# kernel WITHOUT calling it -- the descriptor format, and the packager that
# hydrates a spec from that descriptor. Those live downstream, so the failure
# surfaces as "this arch needs its own file format", months later, far from the
# commit that caused it. `gfx942`'s `build_attention_dense(spec, tuning, *,
# arch)` is exactly that story. This test moves the failure to authoring time,
# in rocke's own CI, on the commit that introduces it.
#
# The walk is over SUBMODULES, not over the top-level `kernels` namespace, on
# purpose: re-exporting a builder in `kernels/__init__.py` is optional, so a
# namespace-only walk would let a new builder in a new file escape the contract
# simply by not being re-exported.
#
# There is no allowlist. Every builder under `library/kernels/` satisfies the
# contract today, including the arch-neutral `attention_unified` ones: a builder
# that ignores `arch` still takes it, so a descriptor can name a target without
# calling the builder.
#
# The second half of this file guards the OTHER way a descriptor breaks. Holding
# the signature fixed is only half the contract: the descriptor stores the spec's
# fields, and the packager hydrates the spec back out of them --
# `Gfx942AttentionDenseSpec(**fields_from_the_file)`. A descriptor written today
# lists only the fields that existed the day it was written, so a spec field
# added later without a default makes that call raise `TypeError: missing
# required argument` for every descriptor already in the wild. `REQUIRED_FIELDS`
# freezes the set that is allowed to be mandatory -- the problem shape -- so a
# new tuning knob has to arrive defaulted.

# that a descriptor written before the field existed still hydrates.
#
# Adding a required field here is not a rubber stamp -- it invalidates every
# descriptor and AOT pack already produced for that spec. Prefer a default. A
# default of `None` meaning "resolve through the shipping policy" is the strongest
# form: a descriptor that omits the field then auto-tracks whatever ships, rather
# than freezing the value that happened to be the default the day it was written.
