"""CPU-only tests for the dispatch-layer num_cus resolver + target_ctas knob.

``num_cus`` drives 2D<->3D routing and the 3D segment count. It historically
defaulted to a stale 120, under-subscribing the device (e.g. 304-CU gfx942,
~256-CU gfx950). The resolver turns the sentinel default into the live device CU
count behind an explicit-caller override seam. Auto-resolution covers the arches
in ``_AUTO_RESOLVE_ARCHS`` (gfx942 and gfx950); every other arch keeps the legacy
120. gfx950's segment clamp is conservative -- the num_cus bump never raises an
already-3D split. ``target_ctas`` is the direct device-subscription target
override: when > 0 it replaces ``num_cus * 4`` for routing/segmentation without a
device CU count. These tests mock the device query/arch (no GPU) and assert the
resolution order plus the downstream routing/segment effects.
