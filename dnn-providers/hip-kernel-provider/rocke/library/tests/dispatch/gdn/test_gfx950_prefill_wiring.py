"""Dispatch-to-launch wiring for the gfx950 GDN prefill split path.

GDN prefill is the chunkwise KDA kernel in GDN mode: two split halves
(``chunk_prep`` + ``chunk_scan``), selected by an explicit algorithm pin, with
the scan's ``value_splits`` chosen from a batch-heads-banded tuning table. No
GPU here -- this asserts the request maps onto the right spec, tile and grid.
