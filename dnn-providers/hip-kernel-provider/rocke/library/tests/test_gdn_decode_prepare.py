"""Host-side input-validation guard for the GDN decode kernel, without a GPU.

``prepare`` rejects inputs that would make the kernel read or write outside the
state pool. The decode kernel bounds-checks nothing on device beyond the ``-1``
skip sentinel, so this host guard *is* the memory-safety contract. The checks
raise before any launch, so they are pure host logic that runs on a CPU box --
which is exactly where a "this guard must not be silently dropped" regression
test belongs, rather than behind the on-device ``gpu`` gate.
