"""On-GPU numeric lane for the gfx942 dense flash-attn kernel.

Drives the PUBLIC entry point ``run_attention_dense_torch`` end-to-end on a real
gfx942 GPU and checks max_abs against an fp32 ``scaled_dot_product_attention``
oracle, for both the default and the P4 persistent grid. This is the committed,
CI-collectable form of the acceptance criterion's "functional GPU-numeric bench,
both variants, vs torch fp32 SDPA" -- previously only an out-of-tree verifier.

Specs come from the gfx942 DISPATCH factory, never hand-rolled (see :func:`_spec`),
so every row compiles the binary that actually ships rather than one that differs
from it by an untracked tuning default.

Every test is marked ``gpu`` and gated with a device skipif, so it is a graceful
skip on a CPU CI box and only executes on a gfx942 (MI300X) ROCm runner. Select
it with ``run_all.py --gpu`` (or ``pytest -m gpu``); the default CPU lane excludes
it via ``-m "not gpu"``. Run standalone:

    HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m pytest tests/test_attention_dense_gfx942_numeric.py

    """The SHIPPED gfx942 dense spec for a cohort row, built through the dispatch
    factory (``dispatch.attention.gfx942._dense_spec``) rather than hand-rolled.

    Hand-rolling the spec silently pins every tuned lever to the shared (gfx950)
    dataclass default, so the lane would assert on configs that do not ship. The
    concrete one this cohort hit: ``waves_per_eu``. Dispatch resolves it from the
    kernel's own policy (``_tuned_waves_per_eu``), which returns 4 for bf16/D64 --
    the row ``_COHORT`` above labels "the wpe=4 config" -- while the dataclass default
    is 2. That is not a cosmetic difference: ``waves_per_eu`` is emitted as the
    ``amdgpu-waves-per-eu`` attribute, changes register allocation, and is tagged into
    ``gfx942_kernel_name`` as ``wpe{N}``, so wpe2 and wpe4 are DIFFERENT binaries.
    ``num_persistent`` was likewise hard-coded to 304 beside a dispatch constant that
    already resolves to 304 -- left at the request default here so ``_dense_spec``
    substitutes the gfx942 CU count itself and the two cannot drift apart.

    Deriving the spec from the factory (the pattern
    ``test_attention_dense_gfx942_golden.py::mk_dispatch`` uses for its D64 cases)
    also means a future gfx942 tuning change is picked up here with no edit.

    Only ``dense_persistent`` is pinned rather than left on "auto": the cohort asserts
    BOTH grid variants at one fixed Sq, where "auto" would pick a single one. Every
    other lever -- block_n, the D64 K row-group pad, persist_decode, ragged -- is
    whatever the shipped path folds in.
