"""On-GPU numeric lane for the chunkwise KDA family on gfx950.

Two references, deliberately independent of each other and of the kernels:

- The six per-chunk tiles are checked against a float64 torch oracle that
  builds them from the pairwise exponent *difference*, with no midpoint
  factoring -- so it never forms the overflowing ``Gamma_i / Gamma_j`` the
  kernel is designed around, and agreement is a check of that factoring rather
  than a restatement of it.
- Both full forward paths are checked against a token-serial float64 walk of
  the gated delta rule. That oracle is not chunked at all, so agreement tests
  the chunkwise factorization itself.

The gate range is swept to -5, the reference ``gate_lower_bound``: a 32-token chunk
accumulates up to 160 nats there, which is the regime that saturates the
factored exponents and the only one where the clamping actually matters.

Every test is marked ``gpu`` and skipped off a gfx950. Select with
``run_all.py --gpu`` (or ``pytest -m gpu``); the default CPU lane excludes it.
