"""gfx950 chunkwise KDA candidates (CDNA4, bf16, K-packed bf16 MFMA).

``kernels/gfx950/kda_chunkwise.py`` has carried specs, validators, builders,
grid helpers and signatures since it landed, and nothing referenced them from
dispatch -- the family was compilable but unreachable. This module is the
registration that makes it selectable.

Three candidates, one per emitted kernel, because each is separately
compilable with its own grid and ABI:

* ``kda_gfx950_chunk_fused`` -- the whole prefill in one kernel. Default.
* ``kda_gfx950_chunk_prep``  -- split path, phase 1 (per-chunk tiles to HBM).
* ``kda_gfx950_chunk_scan``  -- split path, phase 2 (state scan over tiles).

The split halves are opt-in and must be launched in that order; see
:mod:`.common` for why there is no automatic fused/split routing yet.

The two paths do not share a tile schedule, and neither is transcribed here.
The fused kernel carries its own tuned one (a 512-thread panel mapping over
wider row pitches, which is what keeps eight waves resident while the state
lives in registers); the split scan is deliberately capped so two workgroups
fit per CU. Each candidate therefore starts from its own spec's default tile
and overrides only the requested chunk.
