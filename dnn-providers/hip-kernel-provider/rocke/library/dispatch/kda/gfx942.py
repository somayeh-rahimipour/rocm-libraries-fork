"""gfx942 chunkwise KDA candidates (CDNA3, bf16, 16x16x16 MFMA).

``kernels/gfx942/kda_chunkwise.py`` has carried specs, validators, builders,
grid helpers and signatures since it landed, and nothing referenced them from
dispatch -- the family was compilable but unreachable. This module is the
registration that makes it selectable.

Three candidates, one per emitted kernel, because each is separately
compilable with its own grid and ABI:

* ``kda_gfx942_chunk_fused`` -- the whole prefill in one kernel. Default.
* ``kda_gfx942_chunk_prep``  -- split path, phase 1 (per-chunk tiles to HBM).
* ``kda_gfx942_chunk_scan``  -- split path, phase 2 (state scan over tiles).

The split halves are opt-in and must be launched in that order; see
:mod:`.common` for why there is no automatic fused/split routing yet.
