"""Shared pieces of the KDA family: the request and the gates every candidate
re-uses.

Arch-neutral by construction: each arch module imports this one and nothing
here imports an arch module, which keeps the
registry assembly in ``__init__`` free of import-order dependence.

SCOPE -- what this dispatcher decides
-------------------------------------
Which of the two chunkwise prefill paths runs: the **fused** kernel (one
workgroup per recurrence stream walks that stream's chunks, keeping the six
per-chunk tiles in LDS), or the **split** path (a tile-builder kernel that is
one workgroup per chunk, then a state-scan kernel over the materialized tiles).
Both compute the same recurrence and trade HBM traffic against parallelism.

The request carries the *logical* value width ``head_v``. gfx942 partitions a
logical head into ``KDA_PARTITION_HEAD_V``-channel workgroups to fit its LDS
budget; gfx950 keeps the whole value width in one recurrence stream and may
apply the scan spec's own ``value_splits`` in its grid helper.

DEFERRED -- the fused/split crossover
-------------------------------------
The available measurements do not establish a stable cross-architecture
threshold, so the split candidates are **opt-in** and fused is the default.
Naming ``algorithm="chunk_prep"`` / ``"chunk_scan"`` selects the split halves.

Also deferred: ``bind``. gfx942 launches through its manifest host pack while
gfx950 launches through ``KernelLauncher`` with torch tensors. The split path
also needs two launches and a tile workspace, which is not represented by one
:class:`~rocke.dispatch.core.ProblemBinding`.
