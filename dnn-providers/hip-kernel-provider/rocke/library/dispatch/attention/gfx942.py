"""gfx942 attention candidates (CDNA3, wave64).

Two families live here and they do not share an MFMA atom: the unified
``dense_pipe`` flash path runs on the narrow 16x16x16 atom, while the standalone
``attention_dense`` prefill kernel runs on 32x32x8 (CDNA3 has no 32x32x16 fp16/bf16
atom, so it doubles the K loop). See ``builders/gfx942/attention/prefill/README.md``
for why the dense kernel is a per-gfx module rather than an arch branch in the
gfx950 body.

    The gfx942 twin of :func:`dispatch.attention.gfx950._dense_spec`. Same shape
    logic -- persistent ("auto") turns on the grid-stride variant once there is
    enough work to fill the persistent grid (``nqb*Hq*B >= num_persistent``, the
    large-Sq prefill regime), and non-tile-multiple self-attention lengths take the
    on-chip ragged path (no host pad) -- but a different tuning, which is the whole
    reason the two are separate functions rather than one with an arch branch:

    * ``num_persistent`` defaults to :data:`_GFX942_NUM_PERSISTENT` (304 CUs) rather
      than the shared 256. It drives BOTH the auto persistent decision and the grid
      size, so it is resolved before the mode branch.
    * ``waves_per_eu`` comes from the kernel's own per-config policy
      (``_tuned_waves_per_eu``) rather than being pinned here. That is the general
      rule this factory follows, not a one-off: any value the kernel bakes into its
      ``kernel_name`` must be resolved by the kernel's policy, or the name tag and
      the compiled binary can disagree and the name-keyed launcher cache serves the
      wrong HSACO.
    The D64 K row-group pad is deliberately NOT set here: it is the shared
    ``lds_k_group_pad`` field, whose default (8) is already the value gfx942 wants,
    and which the gfx942 builder reads directly. Restating it would reintroduce the
    per-arch duplicate that collapsing the two fields removed.

    Nothing here touches ``Gfx942DenseTuning``: every gfx942-private codegen knob
    (block_m, the two LDS pads, cfvst / exp2_fast forcing, iglp) stays at its shipped
    default, so those knobs are sweep-visible and dispatch-invisible. Wiring one of
    them into this factory would make it a production path and would need its own
    measured verdict first.

    The spec dataclass itself is REUSED from the gfx950 kernel module (as the gfx942
    kernel body reuses it); it is arch-neutral, only its tuned values differ.
