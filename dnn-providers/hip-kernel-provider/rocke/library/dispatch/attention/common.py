"""Shared pieces of the attention family: request, spec, and the gates every
candidate re-uses.

Everything here is arch-neutral by construction. The arch modules import from
this one; nothing here imports them, which is what keeps the registry assembly
in ``__init__`` free of import-order dependence.

SCOPE -- what this dispatcher decides
-------------------------------------
The load-bearing dispatch decision for unified attention is the *kernel path*:
the 2D-tiled (per-(kv_head, q_block) CTA) kernel vs the 3D split-KV kernel. That
decision is a PURE function of the problem
(:func:`rocke.helpers.attention.use_2d_kernel`, surfaced as
``UnifiedAttentionProblem.select_path``), so it can be mirrored byte-faithfully
on the C++ side. Backend coverage is gated by
:func:`attention_unified.supports_native_unified_attention` (head_size /
block_size / dtype / feature gate -- also pure).

The structural identity used for selection parity is therefore::

    (path, head_size, block_size)

where ``path`` is ``"2d"`` or ``"3d"``.

DEFERRED -- arch-tuned block geometry
-------------------------------------
The 2D-tiled kernel's exact CTA geometry (``num_warps`` / ``block_m_per_warp`` /
``tile_size``) is chosen by heuristics in ``attention_unified`` that query the
running device arch (``_resolve_attention_arch``) and encode many measured,
shape-specific thresholds (see ``_select_2d_num_warps`` et al.). Those are
downstream PERFORMANCE-TUNING knobs, not a "which kernel family" decision, and
they are not reproducible CPU-only without a device. They are intentionally OUT
of the parity identity here; modelling them faithfully across C++/Python is a
separate, larger effort. This dispatcher selects the path + backend; geometry is
left to the instance builder at launch time.

That deferral is also why the unified candidates report ``grid=(0, 0, 0)`` and
an empty ``signature``, and so cannot carry a ``bind``: there is no geometry to
bind to until phase 6 moves the routing policy up.
