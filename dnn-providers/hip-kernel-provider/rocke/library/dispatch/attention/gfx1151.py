"""gfx1151 attention candidates (wave32 RDNA3.5, 16x16x16 WMMA).

``kernels/gfx1151/wmma_fmha_swapqk.py`` is the production dense-attention
forward kernel for Strix Halo, but it was reachable only through the standalone
verify scripts in ``builders/gfx1151/attention``; dispatch had no gfx1151 entry
at all. This module is the registration that makes it dispatchable.

Like the gfx1250 WMMA candidate it declares real launch geometry rather than
deferring to the device: the grid is ``(seqlen_q // q_rows_per_cta,
num_query_heads // gqa_fuse, batch)`` and the argument list is fixed.

**V layout is a caller contract.** ``SwapQKCfg.v_transposed`` defaults to True,
which makes V a ``[B, Hk, D, Sk]`` tensor rather than ``[B, Sk, Hk, D]``. The
dispatcher does not relayout tensors -- ``select_spec`` hands back the kernel's
own ``SwapQKCfg`` and the caller feeds it. Callers relay with
``swapqk_transpose_v``; :func:`bindings.bind_swapqk_torch` shape-checks V so a
row-major tensor fails loudly instead of returning plausible garbage.
