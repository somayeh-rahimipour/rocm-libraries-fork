"""Arch-neutral vocabulary for the GDN *prefill* dispatcher family.

GDN prefill is the chunkwise KDA kernel run in its GDN mode: a gated
delta-rule recurrence whose forget gate is one scalar per (token, head)
(``-exp(A_log) * softplus(a + dt_bias)`` broadcast across the key dimension),
rather than KDA's per-channel vector gate. Everything else -- the six per-chunk
tiles, the triangular solve, the serial state scan -- is the KDA machinery.

Because the in-kernel GDN gate lives only on the split path's raw prep kernel
(the fused kernel is packed-only and cannot emit it), this family ships the two
split halves and no fused candidate. The two halves are selected by an explicit
``algorithm`` pin (``"chunk_prep"`` then ``"chunk_scan"``); there is no single
fused default to fall back on, so ``algorithm="auto"`` is rejected rather than
silently resolved to one half of a two-launch path.

This module holds only what describes a *problem*: the request dataclass, the
family identity, the dimension vocabulary, and the shared request/selector
validation. Arch-specific capability, spec construction and the tuned
``value_splits`` table live in the per-arch module (``prefill_gfx950.py``).

    """One chunkwise GDN prefill problem (many tokens at once).

    ``seqlen`` is the padded per-sequence length; this family has no varlen
    path, so a ragged batch must be padded by the caller to a multiple of the
    chunk size. An omitted ``chunk_size`` selects the gfx950 tuned default (32).

    Head counts are GQA: ``num_v_heads`` value heads are the recurrence streams,
    each reading the key head ``head // kv_group``. ``kv_group = 1`` is MHA.
    The field names mirror :class:`GdnDecodeRequest` so the two GDN operators
    can share one request lineage when the families are consolidated.

    Supported decay range (accepted limit, 2026-09-04): the GDN gate
    ``-exp(A_log)*softplus(a+dt_bias)`` is unbounded, but the chunkwise decay
    stabilization is sized for the KDA ``gate_lower_bound=-5`` reference
    (~160 nats over a 32-token chunk). A head whose per-token decay is steeper
    degrades (one head, silently). Trained GDN keeps ``exp(A_log)*dt`` small, well
    inside this; steeper decay is out of range by design. See the vault "KNOWN
    NUMERICAL LIMIT" note (option (c), nested chunking, is the backlog fix).
