"""Arch-neutral vocabulary for the GDN decode dispatcher family.

Holds everything that describes a *problem* rather than a chip: the request
dataclass, the family identity, the dimension vocabulary the registry may gate
on, and the shared request/selector validation. Arch-specific capability and
tile selection live in the per-arch modules (``gfx950.py``), so adding another
arch does not touch this file.

    ``batch`` is the number of *active* sequences this step. It always
    contributes to the launch grid.

    For ``gate_kind="gdn"``, ``auto`` uses the static ``DEFAULT_TILE`` whenever
    it is legal; otherwise dispatch chooses a validator-admitted fallback.
    Neither ``batch`` nor ``num_v_heads`` chooses GDN's auto tile.

    For ``gate_kind="kda"``, ``auto`` is keyed on ``batch * num_v_heads`` -- the
    "work" -- so tensor parallelism selects the tile for heads local to a rank.

    ``gate_kind`` selects the forget-gate granularity: ``"gdn"`` (one scalar
    decay per head) or ``"kda"`` (a per-channel decay). It reaches the spec and
    therefore the kernel name, so the two never share a compile-cache entry.

    ``seq_len`` is not a field. This family is decode-only -- one token per
    sequence -- and a request carrying any other sequence length would be a
    different operator, so it is rejected rather than silently accepted.
