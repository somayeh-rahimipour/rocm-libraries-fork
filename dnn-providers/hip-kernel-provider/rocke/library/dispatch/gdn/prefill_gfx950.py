"""gfx950 candidates and tuned ``value_splits`` selection for GDN prefill.

The two split halves of the chunkwise KDA kernel, run in GDN mode:

* ``chunk_prep`` -- the state-independent per-chunk tile builder, with the raw
  token-major GDN gate fused in (``gate_kind="gdn"``, ``kv_group`` GQA gather,
  q/k L2-norm + softplus gate + beta sigmoid all fused).
* ``chunk_scan`` -- the serial state scan over the materialized tiles, whose
  ``value_splits`` fans the value dimension across workgroups to manufacture
  parallelism at low ``BH``.

Both are selected by an explicit ``algorithm`` pin; there is no fused GDN
kernel, so ``auto`` does not resolve here (see :mod:`.prefill_common`).

Tuned ``value_splits`` table
----------------------------
Measured on gfx950 (correctness-gated vs the fp64 oracle): the
serial scan is parallelism-starved at small ``BH`` and ``value_splits`` fills
the GPU. The optimum is per-``BH``; each split also fixes the scan tile's block
size (and the ``vs=8`` atom), because the scan block must cover the split V
extent. Raw prep always keeps the 256-thread builder regardless of the split.

    does not produce, so admitting one whose prep cannot build hands the caller
    half a split path and moves the failure to whoever launched the two halves
    in order, well past the gate whose job was to name the reason.

    Chaining matches the family's other composite validators --
