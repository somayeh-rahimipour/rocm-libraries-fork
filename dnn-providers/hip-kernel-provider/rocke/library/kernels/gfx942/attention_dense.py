"""Dense flash-attention prefill kernel for gfx942 (CDNA3).

Port of the gfx950 dense prefill kernel (``kernels/gfx950/attention_dense.py``,
from PR #9480) to CDNA3.

This is a SEPARATE kernel from the gfx950 sibling by design: the gfx950 body bakes
in CDNA4-only primitives that do not exist on gfx942, so the two algorithms
genuinely diverge (per ``dsl_docs/architecture/multi_arch_data_layout.md``: split
into per-gfx modules the moment the K-loop shape / memory path / fused phases
differ). Keeping them in separate files also keeps the gfx950 golden IR
(``tests/golden/attention_dense_ir_sha256.json``) byte-identical by construction.

Why this is a port, not a copy (the CDNA3 deltas)
-------------------------------------------------
  * **MFMA atom.** gfx950 uses the wide-K ``mfma_f32_32x32x16`` atom (K=16). CDNA3
    has NO 32x32x16 fp16/bf16 instruction — only ``mfma_f32_32x32x8`` (K=8, the
    ``.1k`` bf16 variant). The 32x32x16 warp tile lowers to 2x ``32x32x8`` on
    gfx942 (K-loop doubling; A/B repack ``<8xelem>`` -> ``<4xelem>``/lane). The
    C-output lane layout is IDENTICAL between the two atoms, so softmax reductions
    and the epilogue are unchanged. See ``helpers.attention.mfma_32x32x8_for_dtype``.
  * **Conflict-free V.** gfx950's CK-1 transposed PV uses ``ds_read_b64_tr_b16``
    (transpose read) for the half-local V load. gfx942 has NO ``ds_read_tr16`` and
    NO ``permlane32_swap``. The CDNA3 vehicle is a ``perm_b32`` STORE-path transpose
    (CK ``transpose_vectors`` masks) into a transposed ``V_lds`` — the same vehicle in
    ``kernels/gfx942/attention_tiled_2d.py`` (``use_conflict_free_v_store``). Its
    parked "1/8 sign-flip" symptom was reproduced-or-disproven before anything was
    lifted: DISPROVEN cross-part (both the 228- and 304-CU parts, bit-identical, no
    sign mismatches), so the vehicle is proven correct rather than merely untested.
    It is lifted here for D128 fp16 as :func:`_use_cfvst` — the barrier caveat is
    that V publication becomes an in-loop ``ds_write``, so the tile-START rendezvous
    needs an lgkmcnt drain (``sync_lds_only``), not a bare barrier. The disproof
    procedure and its evidence are recorded in the gfx942 dense-prefill
    optimization plan, which is kept outside the repo.
  * **LDS / occupancy.** gfx942 has 64 KB LDS/CU (vs gfx950's 160 KB); occupancy /
    ``num_persistent`` / block sizing must be re-derived for the 228- and 304-CU
    gfx942 parts rather than inherited from the gfx950 tuning.

Problem category (drives the optimization order)
------------------------------------------------
**Measured bound (rocprofv3 PMC over the Step-0 config sweep): occupancy-bound ->
MFMA-starved.** MFMA issue rate sits far under the runbook's compute-bound
threshold while waves/CU sit at a small fraction of the per-CU maximum; L2 hit rate
and the memory-stall counter rule out HBM/L2 as the primary limit, and no in-scope
config spills. Per the runbook §3.1a decision tree -- a short-circuiting chain whose
FIRST branch is ``occupancy < 0.5`` -- the classification resolves at occupancy and
never reaches the ``LDS_BOUND`` branch.

**This SUPERSEDES the earlier "LDS-bank-conflict-bound" framing** that was inherited
from the gfx942 tiled-2D kernel and used to order P0-P5. That framing was a good
guide and it paid off -- P1 conflict-free V and the P3 D64 K bank-pad each removed a
large bank-conflict cost -- but it does not describe the kernel that remains. Two
findings retire it:

  * Post-P1/P3 the residual bank-conflict RATE no longer tracks throughput: within a
    fixed shape/dtype, configs with several times the conflict rate are level with or
    faster than their low-rate siblings. The counter is conflicts per LDS-active
    cycle, so a lever that removes LDS instructions (cfvst: 128 -> ~32 LDS instrs per
    tile at D128) shrinks the denominator and can RAISE the rate while lowering the
    cost. Rate is not cost; only an ablation prices LDS.
  * Occupancy trips the decision tree first, so LDS conflicts cannot be the governing
    limiter regardless of their rate.

What still follows from this, unchanged: NOT compute-bound and NOT HBM-bound, so
compute-side scheduling levers that win on the compute-bound gfx950 dense kernel
(``s_setprio``, diagonal two-phase peel) stay PROVEN-NEGATIVE on gfx942 and are NOT
ported, and bandwidth-saving levers stay demoted. What changes: the dominant
remaining lever is **occupancy** (D128 -> 2 WG/CU), not a further LDS-conflict fix.
That is a combined-constraint problem -- it needs LDS <= 32 KB AND the total-register
floor cut TOGETHER (D128 carries a large AGPR residency on top of its architected
VGPRs). Dropping the LDS pads alone to buy the LDS half is PROVEN-NEGATIVE and
catastrophically so: occupancy does not move (the register floor co-limits) and the
K/V bank conflicts come straight back.

Measured conflict rates, pipe utilisation and per-lever deltas are recorded outside
the repo -- see the optimization plan and the protected results page.

Implementation status (the optimization plan holds the full ordered work list)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * P0  enablement + 32x32x8 atom + K-loop doubling ............ DONE (this file)
  * P1  conflict-free V (perm_b32 store-path transpose) ........ DONE (D128 fp16)
  * P2  exp2_fast + fused rescale .............................. DONE (exp2_fast for
        ALL configs incl. bf16 D128; fused rescale bit-identical, and is what
        enabled bf16 D64 exp2_fast)
  * P3  occupancy: waves-per-eu tune (bf16 D64 -> wpe4 = 2 WG/CU),
        D64 K bank-pad, wide4 (WG=256), K single-buffer ........... IN PROGRESS
        (waves-per-eu DONE via _tuned_waves_per_eu; **D64 K bank-pad DONE and ADOPTED**
        -- cross-part-confirmed large win on both D64 dtypes, wired per-config via
        the SHARED ``spec.lds_k_group_pad`` (the same field and formula gfx950
        uses -- one lever, not a per-arch duplicate), golden re-blessed against the
        shipped path; wide4 / K-single-buf still TODO. D128 -> 2 WG/CU is the open
        item and needs the LDS and register floors cut together -- see "Problem
        category" above. ``block_m`` is a further occupancy axis: contrary to the
        gfx950 sibling's "kernel FAULTS at other values" comment, every ``BLOCK_M``
        use in THIS body is parametric (the invariant is ``BLOCK_M == 32 * WAVES``),
        but shrinking it adds CTAs without adding a CTA/CU -- LDS is BLOCK_M-
        invariant -- and costs VGPRs on the K-side DMA addressing, so it is a modest
        win on two of four shapes and a loss elsewhere; now exposed as
        ``Gfx942DenseTuning.block_m`` so re-testing it is a sweep argument rather
        than a source edit, and still DEFAULT-OFF at the shared ``_BLOCK_M``.)
  * P4  persistent grid-stride + qb/hkv_major decode .......... DONE (both decodes;
        shared _run_work_item body; auto-on for large Sq via dispatch, validated
        cross-part for every config by the ON/OFF ablation -- KEEP everywhere)
  * P5  diagonal masking (re-test only), partial-vmcnt prefetch  N/A (see below)

P5 is deliberately no-op for this kernel (a decision, not code):
  * Diagonal two-phase peel: the plan gates it on "re-test ONLY if the bound shifts
    to compute after P1-P4." It has not -- the rocprof sweep confirms D128 is still
    occupancy/latency-bound at 1 WG/CU and nowhere near compute-bound -- and the peel
    was proven negative on gfx942 tiled_2d via register pressure, which D128 (at its
    register floor) is the most exposed to. Keep the single-phase mask.
  * partial-vmcnt software prefetch: N/A here, but NOT for the reason previously
    recorded. It is a double-buffered pipelining lever and this kernel is
    single-buffered (NBUF=1), so there is no prefetch to partially overlap. The old
    "NBUF=2 does not fit 64 KB LDS at D128" justification is only true at the shipped
    ``block_n=64``: at ``block_n=32`` D128 LDS roughly halves and NBUF=2 DOES fit.
    That door is closed by measurement instead -- ``block_n=32`` was GPU-timed in the
    Step-0 funnel and is proven-negative for fp16 D128 and only part-dependently
    positive for bf16 D128 (halving the KV tile doubles the tile/grid count and the
    extra loop/barrier overhead outweighs the LDS relief while occupancy stays
    pinned), so it is not wired and the prefetch it would unlock is unreachable on
    the shipped config. Independently, bounding the live set with partial ``vmcnt=N``
    waits entangles with the K async DMA, which shares the same counter -- see the
    reverted cfvst-chunking experiment recorded in the ``V_ITEMS`` NOTE below.

P1 conflict-free V (:func:`_use_cfvst`): V is stored TRANSPOSED via a perm_b32
store-path transpose so the PV A-operand read is a contiguous ds_read_b64 instead of
P0's 4 element-wise ds_read_u16 (128 -> ~32 LDS instrs/tile at D128). Gated to
**D128 fp16**: D64 is VGPR-bound so the register round-trip regresses it, and D128
bf16 spills over the waves-per-eu=2 cap (a P2/P3 register-headroom item). The lever
is numerically identity-preserving (same MFMA operands; only the LDS layout and read
width change) -- the cohort's ``max_abs`` is unchanged from the naive path. The
conflict-free vehicle was proven correct cross-part before being lifted (see the
optimization plan for the disproof procedure).

P0 is CORRECTNESS-FIRST: the naive-V path (D64 / bf16-D128) is non-pipelined (a
single LDS buffer) and reads V element-wise; the remaining perf levers (P2-P4) layer
on top. It is validated against an fp32 SDPA reference across the in-scope cohort.

:func:`supports_attention_dense` is the SINGLE gate: it rejects every spec
:func:`build_attention_dense` cannot emit -- including the modes deferred to later
phases -- so ``supports_attention_dense(spec)[0] is True`` implies the build
succeeds. Dispatch keys on it, which is what stops an out-of-scope request from
selecting this arm and then failing at build time.

The compile-time spec (:class:`AttentionDenseSpec`) is REUSED from the gfx950
module: batch / seqlen / heads / head_size / causal / dtype / knobs are arch-neutral
(compile-time shape + tuning). gfx942-specific tuning DEFAULTS (e.g. num_persistent
for the gfx942 CU count) are applied in the builder / dispatch layer, not by forking
the dataclass.

Knobs that are gfx942-ONLY -- because gfx950 either cannot emit them or emits them
from a different derivation -- live in :class:`Gfx942DenseTuning` instead, a
gfx942-owned struct threaded through every entry point with a shipped default. It
never touches ``AttentionDenseSpec.kernel_name()`` (the emitted symbol, and a gfx950
golden), and it is invisible to dispatch: production always takes the default.

class Gfx942DenseTuning:
    """gfx942-private codegen knobs for the dense prefill body.

    SEPARATE from :class:`AttentionDenseSpec` on purpose, and not a fork of it. The
    spec is the arch-neutral compile-time PROBLEM (shape, plus the tuning gfx950 also
    owns) and it is emitted into the IR as the kernel symbol via
    ``spec.kernel_name()`` -- extending it would move an 18-case gfx950 golden
    (``platform/tests/golden/rocke_representative_ir_sha256.json``) and the C++/Python
    parity gate. This struct is the gfx942 SWEEP surface instead: dispatch leaves
    every field at its default, so it is invisible in production and fully
    addressable from a harness.

    Tri-state fields: ``None`` means "use the measured policy"
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    ``use_cfvst`` / ``use_exp2_fast`` / ``waves_per_eu`` default to ``None``, which
    resolves through the shipping policy (:func:`_use_cfvst`, :func:`_use_exp2_fast`,
    and ``spec.waves_per_eu`` -- which the gfx942 dispatch fills from
    :func:`_tuned_waves_per_eu`). That tri-state is the whole point of the struct: a
    harness that omits a VALUED field freezes the config at whatever the default
    happened to be the day it was written and then silently reports a stale verdict
    (that is exactly how a real +79% got reported as -17% in this tree). A harness
    that omits a ``None`` field auto-tracks whatever ships. Omission becomes safe.

    The policy functions stay the SINGLE resolution point -- their docstrings are the
    evidence ledger, and their verdicts are deliberately NOT copied into the defaults
    here, so there is nothing to drift.

    Naming / launcher-cache safety
    ------------------------------
    Every field that can change codegen is tagged into :func:`gfx942_kernel_name`,
    but ONLY when it differs from the default (or, for the tri-state fields, from
    what the policy would have produced) -- so at shipped defaults the names, and the
    goldens, are byte-identical. Conditional tagging is the existing idiom
    (``AttentionDenseSpec.kernel_name`` emits ``kpad{N}`` only on the packed path and
    ``persist{N}`` only when persistent), and it is load-bearing rather than
    cosmetic: ``_DENSE_LAUNCHER_CACHE`` is keyed on the kernel name and its
    ``assert art.kernel_name == key`` PASSES on a name collision, so an untagged
    IR-affecting knob silently serves a stale binary. This kernel has shipped that
    exact bug twice (``batch``, then ``waves_per_eu``).

    :func:`supports_attention_dense` validates this struct, not just the builder: the
    module contract is that ``supports(spec, tuning=t)[0] is True`` implies
    ``build_attention_dense(spec, tuning=t)`` succeeds.

    #     * Bank geometry does not transfer. gfx950 has 64 LDS banks, gfx942 has 32
    #       (``platform/dsl_docs/optimization/arch/gfx950.md`` §21.2 "LDS specifics"
    #       table; ``platform/dsl_docs/optimization/arch/gfx942.md`` §21.2), and the
    #       shared pad derivation is written against the 64-bank model verbatim --
    #       "LDS delivers 64 banks x 4 B = 256 B/cycle" (``AttentionDenseSpec``'s
    #       ``lds_k_group_pad`` comment in ``kernels/gfx950/attention_dense.py``). The

    #       transferable, let alone the magnitude.
    #     * 8 did not survive a sweep on the arch it came from. gfx950's own sweep of
    #       the analogous V pad measured conflicts {pad 0: 30, pad 8: 29, pad 16: 11,
    #       pad 32: 0} -- i.e. +8 was essentially indistinguishable from no pad at all
    #       (``kernels/gfx950/attention_dense.py`` module docstring / ``_LDS_PAD_V``).

    #     * Timed: PROVEN-NEUTRAL on both parts. Its only visible effect is shifting
    #       the architected-VGPR / AGPR split (88/128 -> 128/128 at fp16 D128) at
    #       equal total registers, which does not move the clock.
    #   The neutrality is itself the useful result, per runbook §8.6 (barrier-bound vs
    #   schedule-bound): a canned MFMA/DS interleave buying nothing means the main
    #   loop is NOT schedule-bound -- it is barrier-rendezvous-bound, which no
    #   scheduling hint can fix. That matches the measured occupancy bound in the

    Both arches pad between async-DMA row-GROUPS by the same formula
    (``rows_per_instr * head_size + pad``, see :func:`_k_group_stride`) for the same
    reason, so this is one lever with one field rather than a per-arch duplicate.
    gfx942 derived the pad from a measured ~2x ON/OFF ablation, gfx950 from a
    bank/phase model, and both landed on the same 8-element default.

    Active only on the PACKED path (``rows_per_instr > 1``, i.e. D64 here): D128
    already carries a per-row K pad via :func:`_lds_row_stride`, so it must never
    be re-padded. ``lds_k_group_pad=0`` reproduces the unpadded layout for A/B --
    which is also how the pad's ~2x is priced, no module-level probe constant needed.

    What the pad does
    -----------------
    With a non-zero pad the D64 ``K_lds`` takes a *row-group boundary* pad, so the
    ``do_qk`` K reads drop from a full 32-way bank conflict to 4-way (matching D128)
    WITHOUT losing async-DMA efficiency: the contiguous 2-rows-per-instruction DMA
    still writes one whole group per instruction, and the pad sits at the group
    boundary it never touches. This is the "swizzled LDS layout" arm of the
    hypothesis, and it is strictly better than the other arm that was considered --
    ``ROWS_PER_INSTR=1`` plus half the DMA efficiency.

    MECHANISM (corrected -- a proven negative, do not re-derive)
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    The static codegen A/B is IDENTICAL with the pad on and off: VGPR count, the
    LDS-instruction stream and the ``s_nop`` padding are all unchanged. The
    once-hypothesised "the pad frees registers -> more ILP -> compounding win"
    mechanism is therefore DEBUNKED. The win is purely eliminated bank-conflict
    REPLAY -- the same ``ds_read`` replayed ~8x at 32-way instead of ~4-way -- which
    is a runtime effect and is invisible to any static probe. Re-running a static
    A/B to "explain" this lever will find nothing; only a timed run prices it.

    ``tuning`` is accepted (and ignored) so every LDS-geometry helper takes the same
    ``(spec, tuning)`` call convention: this pad is a SPEC field, not a gfx942 tuning
    field, precisely because gfx950 emits the identical layout from the identical
    formula. Threading the parameter here keeps a future caller from having to know
    which of the two pads it is looking at.
