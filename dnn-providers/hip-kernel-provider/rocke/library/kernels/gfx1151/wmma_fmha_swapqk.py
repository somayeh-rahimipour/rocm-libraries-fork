"""Transposed-QK WMMA FMHA-forward kernel for gfx1151 (CK gfx11 `qr_ks_vs` design).

PRODUCTION kernel (the campaign winner for dense D128 fp16 on gfx1151). There is
one config type, :class:`SwapQKCfg`: its defaults are the swept +
hardware-validated winner (wave2, pingpong ``s_setprio`` scheduling,
buffer-descriptor D16 V-gather, dual-subtile gather, the transposed V layout, the
d-outer QK loop, lazy online-softmax rescale, and fast (raw) exp2), so
``SwapQKCfg(head_size=..., num_query_heads=...)`` is the production
configuration and every other field is an opt-in lever for A/B work. Note that
the transposed V layout means callers pass V as ``[B, H, D, S]`` -- see
:func:`swapqk_transpose_v`.

Use :func:`is_valid_spec` as the cheap static gate and
:func:`build_wmma_fmha_swapqk` / :func:`swapqk_grid` to build and launch. Each
field's docstring records what it measured, including the dead-ends, so the
negative results stay attached to the code they describe rather than living only
in a design doc. See ``ALGORITHM.md`` / ``README.md``.

This is the structural change the register-transpose investigation pointed at. The
gather winner (``fmha_multiwave``) computes ``S = Q*K^T`` (query on the accumulator
slots, kv on the lane), which forces (a) a cross-lane 16-lane butterfly softmax and
(b) an LDS round-trip P-transpose every K-tile (the fixed WMMA ``a_map`` needs a full
16-lane gather that ``permlanex16`` cannot do -- the documented ``p_xpose="shuffle"``
dead-end).

Computing the scores **transposed** ``S^T = K*Q^T`` flips both:

  * **query lands on the lane** (``col = lane%16``), kv on the 8 accumulator slots
    (+ the ``lane^16`` half). So the online softmax reduction over kv is an **in-lane
    reduce over 8 slots + ONE ``permlanex16`` cross-half exchange** -- no 16-lane
    butterfly. The running ``m``/``l`` are scalars per lane (one query per lane).
  * the C->operand P-transpose becomes CK's exact ``PermuteWarpGemmCToA``: one
    ``permlanex16`` + two ``v_perm_b32`` per u32, **NO LDS round-trip, no barrier**.
    It works here (unlike on ``S=Q*K^T``) precisely because query is already on the
    lane -- only kv needs the ``lane^16`` reshuffle.

PV is computed **transposed too**: ``O^T = V*P`` (V is the A operand, P the B
operand). That keeps the PV output ``O^T[d, query]`` with query on the lane -- the
SAME distribution as the softmax stats -- so the online rescale ``O *= alpha`` is a
trivial in-lane vector-mul (no cross-lane alpha redistribution). The cost is a
transposed O store in the epilogue (strided in d), paid once per q-block.

V is still the cache-resident column **gather** (gfx1151 has no ``ds_read_tr``); the
transpose here is on P (registers), not V. Ref: CK
``ck_tile/ops/gemm/warp/warp_wmma_gemm_gfx11_utils.hpp::PermuteWarpGemmCToA`` and

    # causes:
    #   (1) vgpr/spill -- the coop loader's live payload is
    #       block_n*hs*2 / (block_size*4) VGPR. kv_lds staged K+V across 64 threads
    #       = 128 VGPR; K-only across a 256-thread (gqa_fuse=4) CTA = 16 VGPR, an 8x
    #       cut, and the chunk row/col div+mod is loop-invariant so it hoists out.
    #   (2) dsld 0->320 was entirely a V problem: the flat LDS V read is 16
    #       uncoalesced scalar ds_loads per fragment. K costs 64 ds_read_b128.
    #   (3) 2 barriers/tile still cost, but the tile is now shared by 8 waves
    #       (gqa_fuse=4, W=2) instead of 2 -- 4x the amortization.
    # Instruction count is a WASH (vmem 96->36, +64 ds_read +4 ds_write = +8 on a
    # ~1019-instruction loop). What changes is composition: per CTA the K request
    # count drops 512->32 for the same 16 KB of unique bytes (half of today's K
    # requests are pure address-pipe waste -- the A-operand row is lane%16, so lanes

    # The benefit tracks whether the memory unit RESPONDS at all: at L4096 the
    # gather is the constraint and removing 8/9 of the loads removes a fifth of
    # the runtime; by L16384 TA_TA_BUSY is pinned no matter what the load stream
    # looks like, so there is nothing left to win. At L16K the unit is
    # latency-saturated (holding outstanding L2/MALL returns), not

    #
    # This exists to separate the two things the full transpose changes at once.
    # Per K-loop iteration at bn64/D128 the three layouts are:

    # KB=8 is the discriminating point: the transpose's instruction count AND

    # instruction issue or line lookups, KB=8 would be the clear winner.
    #
    # MEASURED (L16384, single-head dispatch, 3 reps, GRBM_GUI_ACTIVE cycles):

    # 9.3% MORE cycles than either, while TA_TA_BUSY is FLAT to within 1% across
    # all three. So KB=8 is the WORST of the three, and the memory-unit busy
    # counter does not budge across an 8x swing in instructions and an 8x swing
    # in lines. That rules out both as the L16K constraint (at L4096, where the
    # gather IS binding, the same counter moves -24%). The kernel is
    # memory-LATENCY bound there: TA reads as ~75% busy because it is holding
    # outstanding L2/MALL returns, and issuing fewer/cheaper requests does not
    # shorten the wait. Kept only as the probe that establishes this; KB=0 is the

    # flight widens the concurrently-touched footprint past what L0/L1 holds, so
    # lines are evicted before the next step reuses them and DRAM reads go up 40x
    # for the same 8.4M loads.
    #
    # The deeper reason this lever cannot pay: at depth 0 the kernel only pulls
    # ~26 MB from DRAM (~4% of available bandwidth), so the latency the waves are
    # hiding is mostly L0/L1/L2-HIT latency on the vector-memory path, not DRAM
    # latency. Adding requests-in-flight cannot cover that without spending the

    #   L2048 bn64: +6.2% (3 interleaved reps). Real win.
    #   L16384 bn64: 11x LOSS. Root cause is a cache-residency collapse, NOT the
    #     occupancy drop: at the real 24-chunk shape L2 misses go 3.75M -> 393M
    #     (105x) and DRAM read 323 MiB -> 47.9 GiB (148x). Grouping lets the
    #     scheduler hoist the gather loads away from their consumers, and the
    #     extra distinct lines in flight blow L2 once 24 heads are resident --
    #     the same failure mode as v_prefetch depth>=3 (0.3M -> 12.4M misses).
    #   L16384 bn32: VGPR stays 179 so occupancy is UNCHANGED (8 waves/SIMD) and
    #     the loop still shrinks 581 -> 500 instructions, yet cycles are FLAT:
    #     issue drops ~5% while stall rises by the same absolute amount. The
    #     freed issue slots convert 1:1 into stall, which says these selects were
    #     never on the critical path -- they were being issued in stall shadow.
    #     Cutting VALU issue is not a lever for this kernel at long L; the memory
    #     path is.
    #
    # NOTE on measuring this: a reduced single-head dispatch reported merely +8%
    # cycles for N=4 at L16384 and completely masked the 11x cliff, which only
    # appears in the full 24-head-chunk shape. Point rocprofv3 at the real
    # head-chunked launch before trusting any long-L verdict. The o_f16 L16384
    # cliff is probably the same effect and is worth re-checking that way.

    # k_dual: the K-side twin of dual_gather. load_wmma_fragment takes the WMMA
    # A-operand row from lane%16, so lanes l and l+16 issue the SAME address and
    # every K load runs at HALF lane efficiency -- at bn64 the 64 K load
    # instructions move 32 KB of traffic for a 16 KB tile. Indexing by the full
    # lane makes the upper half fetch the next sub-tile's 16 keys, so one load
    # covers a kv PAIR, and the existing permlanex16+select broadcast splits it
    # back into two duplicated fragments.
    #
    # Why this is the lever: requests-per-WMMA is pinned at 1.5 for every block_n
    # (32/64/96/128 all measure 1.5), so tiling cannot improve the memory-to-
    # compute ratio -- only reuse can, and MQ=2 does not fit at D=128 (spills 246
    # at bn64, still 40 at bn16+o_f16, because O alone is MQ*n_dk*8 = 128 VGPR).
    # k_dual is the one remaining way to cut requests without more registers: it
    # halves the FLAT loads, taking total in-loop memory instructions from 96 to 64
    # at bn64. It trades the identical 24 VALU per 2 saved loads that dual_gather
    # trades for V, and that trade measured +34% there; bcast_group separately
    # showed this kernel's VALU is issued in stall shadow, so the added broadcast
    # should be closer to free than the arithmetic suggests.
    #
    # Requires qk_douter (the pair-wise kv iteration lives in its d-outer loop) and
    # an even n_kv_sub, i.e. block_n >= 32.
    #
    # MEASURED: correct (max_abs 1.53e-05) and a win at L=2048 (+8%), but an 11x
    # LOSS at L=16384 (3 interleaved reps). The codegen did exactly what it was
    # built to do -- FLAT loads 16.9M -> 8.5M, spill-free, occupancy held, and the
    # doubled broadcast even self-packed into VOPD (42 -> 164 pairs) -- yet
    # TA_TA_BUSY went UP 13% and DRAM read up 13x.
    #
    # WHY, and the general rule: duplicate LANES are free, duplicate INSTRUCTIONS
    # are not. The address unit coalesces the 16 identical addresses inside one
    # global_load_b128 at no cost, so the lane%16 duplication was never costing
    # requests -- halving the instructions bought nothing while making each one span
    # 32 cache lines instead of 16, which costs the residency this kernel lives on.
    # dual_gather is NOT the same case and the symmetry argument was wrong:
    # gather_v_a_frag issues 16 separate load_scalar instructions per V fragment, so
    # V's redundancy is duplicate instructions (uncoalescable, worth 34% to remove).
    # Do not re-attack A-operand lane duplication on a vector-load path.
    k_dual: bool = False
    # num_persistent: >0 replaces the (q_blocks, H, B) grid with a FIXED 1-D grid of
    # this many long-lived CTAs that pull (q_block, head, batch) work-items from a
    # global atomic counter until they are exhausted. 0 = today's one-shot grid.
    #
    # Why this and not another in-loop knob. Three separate in-loop levers
    # (bcast_group, o_f16, k_dual) all won at L=2048 and collapsed at L=16384 via an
    # L2-miss/DRAM explosion, and mem-instructions-per-WMMA is pinned at 1.5 for
    # every block_n, so the binding constraint is CACHE RESIDENCY, not issue slots
    # or request count. A work queue is the first lever that changes *what is
    # resident* rather than trading locality for fewer instructions: with
    # persist_decode="qb_major" a CTA draining adjacent tile ids stays on ONE
    # (head, batch) and reuses that head's K/V out of L2, and deep oversubscription
    # (~24x the CU count) keeps the queue full enough to hide the fetch latency.
    #
    # MQ>1 / q_lds / kv_lds are rejected here: MQ=2 does not fit at D=128 and the
    # LDS paths allocate inside what would become the work-item loop.

    #             reps; pers960 WITHOUT wpe is ~17% down -- see below)
    # Depth is not optional and the curve is monotone in the CTA count: one CTA per
    # CU starves the queue badly, and throughput climbs steadily out to ~1920 CTAs,
    # more than 3x the shallowest point.
    #
    # COST: the work-item loop is +55 VGPR (199 -> 254, spill-free) because
    # loop-invariant setup hoisted out of it stays live across the whole body, which
    # drops 7 -> 6 waves/SIMD. waves_per_eu=8 buys the wave back (192 VGPR, 19
    # spills, 80 B scratch) and recovers most of the loss; this is the one config
    # where wpe=8 helps, since it corrects that regression rather than pushing past
    # a real peak.
    #
    # The schedule itself is emphatically the right idea -- persist_decode alone is
    # worth 21x at L=16K (qb_major over batch_major) -- but the one-shot grid's
    # in-order dispatch already approximates qb_major, so L2 hit only moves
    # 66.0% -> 67.8% and the net is parity. Default off; use it for short L, or when
    # run-to-run stability matters (pers1920 wpe8 holds a ~16x tighter spread than
    # one-shot).

    # q_rows_per_cta is UNCHANGED and each wave still owns exactly one head's O
    # accumulators. Per-wave register pressure is therefore identical, which is
    # the whole point: at 216 VGPR against a 256 ceiling this is the only
    # formulation of head fusion that fits.
    #
    # What it buys: a K/V tile is fetched once and consumed by F*n_waves*16
    # query rows instead of n_waves*16 (128 vs 32 at F=4,W=2) -- Triton's

    # gap vs Triton at the Qwen3-8B prefill shape (Hq32/Hk8/D128/causal).
    #
    # NOTE when measuring: the win needs the F waves running IN phase, and
    # sched_mode="pingpong" exists to drive them OUT of phase (as does
    # lazy_rescale, whose 0/1-trip loop has a per-head trip count). A/B those
    # in the same session or a real win can read as a null.
    #
    # Measured Hq32/Hk8/D128/S2048 causal, qk_douter=False, best config per arm:
    # F=4 is 1.67x on wall clock, TA_TA_BUSY 24.4M -> 12.5M and SQ_BUSY 118.8M ->
    # 65.0M at an identical SQ_WAVES of 4096 and an unchanged 216 VGPR / 0
    # scratch. A pure dispatch swizzle that only co-locates the sharing heads in
    # DISPATCH order (rather than in a CTA) recovers about half of that -- so the
    # cost is partly temporal, but mostly the CUs not sharing the fetch.
    #
    # It is a CONSTANT-FACTOR fix, not a scaling fix: the gain runs 1.17x at
    # S=1024 to 2.06x at S=8192, but the super-linear growth in L is untouched,
