"""Dense flash-attention prefill kernel for gfx950 (MI355X).

Productized from the ``flash_dense_dualwave_swp`` experiment
(``kernels/gfx950/experiments/flash_dense_dualwave_swp/``). This is the shippable
step-1 pipeline with every WINNING lever baked in as always-on (no env gates):

  * **CK-1 transposed PV** — P feeds the PV MFMA in its native QK-output layout via a
    half-local V load (``pv32_v_load_paired``); the cross-half P-relayout shuffle is
    gone (~96 ``ds_bpermute`` removed). +35% over the pre-CK-1 winner.
  * **LDS bank-conflict padding on K** (``[NBUF, BN, D+8]``) — kills the 8-way conflict
    on the QK K-reads. The dominant base win (+80% over the naive baseline).
  * **native exp2_fast** (``v_exp_f32``, no overflow guard — the softmax argument is
    always <= 0) — +11.5%.
  * **full-population ``sched_group_barrier`` template** naming DS_READ/MFMA/VALU/TRANS
    per PV step.
  * **diagonal-only causal masking** — a mask-free body loop over below-diagonal KV
    tiles (~94% at Sq=8192) plus a masked diagonal tail.
  * **depth-1 cluster split** fusing exp2 into the PV MFMA loop for MFMA/VALU co-exec.
  * **partial-vmcnt software prefetch** — the per-tile K/V DMA drain is a partial
    `vmcnt` (keeps the freshest V prefetch in flight across the barrier) instead of a
    full `vmcnt(0)` serialize; raises MfmaUtil, bit-identical.
  * **PV-only `s_setprio`** — the PV MFMA cluster is bracketed at raised priority so
    it wins issue slots; paired with the prefetch this is a measured ~+3.5%.
  * **vectorized O store**.

Measured on MI355X (bf16, D=128, causal, 128/8 GQA, Sq=8192, 0 spill, err ~1.46e-3
vs SDPA). Absolute TFLOPS swing +/-25-30% with auto-clock, so only SAME-SESSION
ratios are load-bearing; one representative session, each number pinned to its
config (grid / decode / V-pad / lazy):

    default grid            (one-CTA/q-block, V-pad 32, lazy on) : ~543 TFLOPS
    persistent baseline     (qb-major,        V-pad 0,  lazy off): ~877 TFLOPS
    persistent + V-pad      (qb-major,        V-pad 32, lazy off): ~912 TFLOPS
    persistent (SHIPPED)    (hkv-major,       V-pad 32, lazy on) : ~948 TFLOPS

Clock-invariant deltas (the load-bearing part): hkv/qb ~1.04x, V-pad 0->32 ~+5%,
lazy ~+2%. Shape (batch/seqlen/heads/head_dim) is baked at build time (dense,
compile-time-sized ABI); the KV tile, occupancy hint, and persistent knobs are the
tunable parameters. Lazy online-softmax rescale (skip the O/l rescale when every
lane's tile-max is within 8 log2 of the running max) is ALWAYS-ON by default
(``lazy_rescale=True``): parity-identical (1.46e-3) and ~+2%.

Head-size / seqlen coverage:
  * ``head_size`` is 64 or 128 (bf16/fp16, MHA + GQA incl. non-power-of-2 NQK).
    D=128 uses the per-row padded LDS fast path (1 K/V row per async-DMA instr).
    D=64 packs 2 rows per instr (64 lanes x 2 bf16 = 128 elems = 2 D=64 rows),
    which rules out a per-row pad because a padded row is not contiguous with
    the next -- so K instead pads between DMA row-GROUPS (``lds_k_group_pad``):
    the group stays contiguous for the DMA while the group pitch restores the
    QK read's bank spread. V still uses the unpadded packed pitch, so a
    conflict-free transposed-V layout remains an open D=64 lever. D=128 codegen
    is byte-identical across this change (same IR hash -> same TFLOPS).
  * ``seqlen_q``/``seqlen_kv`` must be a multiple of 256 / ``block_n`` on the
    default (aligned) kernel. Non-multiple lengths are handled by a SEPARATE
    ``ragged=True`` kernel path (its own kernel_name) that pads the boundary
    tiles ON-CHIP: OOB query rows load as 0 via a bounds-checked buffer load
    (register pad), OOB keys load as 0 into LDS (LDS pad), the grid/work-item
    count is ceil'd to cover the partial last query block, and the partial O rows
    are dropped by a guarded store. Causal needs no key mask (padded ktok >=
    seqlen_kv > every real query, so causal drops them); non-causal adds a
    ktok<seqlen_kv key mask. Self-attention only. The aligned path is emitted
    byte-identically when ``ragged=False`` (no TFLOPS impact).

Experimental/negative levers from the sweep (step-2 8-cluster, K-staging, per-nsub
staging, score truncation, PV V-prefetch) are intentionally NOT carried over — see
the experiment's ``plan.md`` for their measured results.

    tensors ([B, S, H, D] for q/out, [B, Skv, Hkv, D] for k/v); ``scale`` is the
    softmax scale (1/sqrt(D)). Returns ``out``. torch is imported lazily by the
    launcher — this module stays torch-free at import time.

    Arbitrary (non-256-multiple) sequence lengths are served WITHOUT host
    padding by the in-kernel ragged path: build ``spec`` with ``ragged=True``
    and the TRUE (un-rounded) ``seqlen_q``/``seqlen_kv`` and pass the true-length
    q/k/v/out tensors. The kernel pads the boundary tiles on-chip (register-zero
    OOB query rows, LDS-zero OOB keys) and drops the partial O rows; the grid is
    ceil-sized automatically. See the ``ragged`` spec field.

    Varlen (``spec.varlen``): the kernel emits a 7-arg ABI (packed
    ``[total_tok, H, D]`` q/k/v/o + two int32 ``cu_seqlens`` [batch+1]); pass both
    ``cu_seqlens_q`` and ``cu_seqlens_kv`` or a ``ValueError`` is raised (they are
    required — never silently launch the 5-arg ABI against a 7-arg kernel).

    Paged (``spec.paged``): K/V are a PAGED CACHE, not dense tensors -- ``k``/``v``
    are ``[num_kv_blocks, block_size, Hkv, D]`` and are addressed through
    ``block_tables`` indirection. Pass ``block_tables`` (int32
    ``[num_seqs, max_blocks_per_seq]``) and ``kv_lens`` (int32 ``[num_seqs]``); a
    ``ValueError`` is raised if either is missing (or is supplied when
    ``spec.paged`` is False). ``q``/``out`` stay dense/contiguous. Single-sequence
    only in this revision (``batch == 1``); ``spec.block_size`` is the cache page
    size and ``spec.num_kv_blocks`` MUST equal ``k.shape[0]``. ``validate_paged``
    (default True) host-checks the paged CONTENTS (a device->host sync): the used
    ``block_tables`` entries lie in ``[0, num_kv_blocks)``, and each
    ``kv_lens[i] == seqlen_kv`` (the kernel visits all compile-time ``seqlen_kv``
    tiles, so a shorter ``kv_len`` reads page 0 for the uncovered tiles ->
    wrong output). Pass False on the hot / graph-captured path to skip the sync
    (block ids then rely on the bounds-checked cache SRD reading 0, and the
    ``kv_lens == seqlen_kv`` contract becomes the caller's responsibility)."""
