"""Workspace-fold kernel for the two-stage wgrad path.

Stage 2 of the two-stage backward-weight convolution.  Stage 1
(``conv_implicit_gemm_wgrad`` with ``two_stage=True``) f32-atomic-adds its
partial sums into a scratch buffer of shape ``[groups * R, wg_M, wg_N]``, where
``R`` is ``ws_replicas``: each of a group's ``split_k`` slices picks one of that
group's ``R`` replica slabs (by ``block_id_z % R``) and atomically accumulates
into it.  So by the time this kernel runs the reduction over ``split_k`` is
complete *within* each slab, but the ``R`` slabs of a group still have to be
summed.  This kernel folds them and converts f32 -> ``dtype_d`` into ``dW``.

``R`` is a compile-time constant, so the fold is flat and unrolled -- ``R``
independent loads, ``R - 1`` adds, one convert, one store per output element,
no loop.  (It did once carry a *sequential* reduction over a
``[groups * split_k, wg_M, wg_N]`` scratch, i.e. a loop over the reduction
degree.  The grid here is sized by the *output*, which for a wgrad is a
filter-sized handful of elements, so that loop ran on a few CTAs with one
dependent load per iteration and cost more than the Stage 1 GEMM it was
reducing.  The replica count is deliberately decoupled from ``split_k`` so this
stage stays a fixed handful of loads however deep the split gets.)

The replicas exist for Stage 1's sake, not this kernel's: a dW-sized scratch is
a few dozen cache lines, and pointing every CTA's atomics at it serialises them
in L2.  See the ``ws_replicas`` field docs on ``WgradConvSpec``.

``R`` here MUST match the Stage 1 spec's ``ws_replicas`` -- folding fewer slabs
silently drops part of the sum, folding more reads past the buffer.

For grouped convolutions the group slabs are contiguous in both buffers, so
``block_id_z`` indexes group ``g``'s ``R`` scratch slabs and its single ``dW``
slab from the same index.

Kernel signature::

    ws_ptr  : f32 global ptr, readonly      — scratch [groups * R * wg_M * wg_N]
    dw_ptr  : dtype_d global ptr, writeonly — weight gradient [groups * wg_M * wg_N]
    wg_M    : i32   — per-group output-channel dimension (K // groups)
    wg_N    : i32   — per-group filter-spatial × input-channel (Y*X * C//groups)
    ws_bytes: i32   — scratch buffer byte size (ABI boundary)
    dw_bytes: i32   — dW buffer byte size (ABI boundary)
    groups  : i32   — number of convolution groups (1 for non-grouped)

Grid: ``(ceil(wg_N / tile_n), ceil(wg_M / tile_m), groups)``
Block: ``(block_size, 1, 1)`` where ``block_size = tile_m * tile_n`` (flat)
