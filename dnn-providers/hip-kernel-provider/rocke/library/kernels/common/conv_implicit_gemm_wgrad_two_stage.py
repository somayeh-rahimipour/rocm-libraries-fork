"""Two-stage deterministic backward-weight convolution launcher.

Assembles a :class:`~rocke.runtime.launcher.PipelineLauncher` from:

* **Stage 1** — an implicit-GEMM wgrad kernel (``two_stage=True``) that
  writes f32 partial sums into a workspace buffer instead of
  atomic-adding into ``dW``.
* **Stage 2** — a workspace-reduce kernel that sums the f32 workspace
  slices in a fixed sequential order and writes the result as ``dtype_d``
  to ``dW``.

Both stages are submitted on the same HIP stream, so HIP's in-order
execution guarantees Stage 2 begins only after Stage 1 has completed —
no explicit ``hipStreamSynchronize`` is needed between them.

Grouped convolutions (``groups > 1``) are fully supported.  Stage 1 uses
grid ``z = groups * split_k`` so each (group, slice) pair gets its own
workspace slab.  Stage 2 uses grid ``z = groups`` (``block_id_z`` = group
index) and reduces all groups in a single launch.

Usage::

    from dataclasses import replace
    spec = WgradConvSpec(problem=..., split_k=4, two_stage=True)
    pipeline, ws_nbytes = build_implicit_gemm_conv_wgrad_two_stage(spec, arch=arch)

    ws = DeviceMem(ws_nbytes)

        caller must allocate before each pipeline call.

        The workspace has shape ``[split_k, wg_M, wg_N]`` (f32).  Stage 1
        writes every element within ``[0, wg_M) × [0, wg_N)`` via plain

        ``scf_if`` guard.  Stage 2 wraps its entire reduction loop in the
        same OOB guard, so out-of-bounds threads perform no workspace loads
