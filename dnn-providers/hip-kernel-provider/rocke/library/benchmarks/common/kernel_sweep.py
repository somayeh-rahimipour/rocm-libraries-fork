"""The two AOT benchmark modes: build the cache, then run any shape from it.

``--compile-all`` walks the configuration grid for an arch/dtype, builds and
compiles every variant that validates, and stores the HSACOs in an
:class:`~benchmarks.common.kernel_cache.KernelCache`. No GPU is needed and no
shape is involved --
that is what makes the artifacts reusable.

``--run-from-cache`` takes a concrete problem, asks the cache which of its
kernels can run it, and benchmarks those. Nothing is compiled.

The split exists because AOT kernels are shape-generic: the expensive step
(compilation) no longer depends on the problem, so it can be done once and
amortised over every shape the cache is later asked about.

What the implicit-GEMM cache sweeps
-----------------------------------
One binary per point of the grid below that passes its direction's spec
validator (``--compile-all`` prints the per-direction breakdown of what
survived). Values are the ``CACHE_*`` constants of this module; the dtype is
fp16 or bf16 (one cache pass per dtype, A/B/D all of that dtype).

Shared tile geometry, every direction::

    tile_m, tile_n   16, 32, 64, 128, 256
    tile_k           16, 32, 64
    warp_m, warp_n   1, 2, 4, 8   (warp_m * warp_tile must divide tile_m, same for n)
    warp_tile_m/n    16, 32       (square; warp_tile_k = the widest MMA atom
                                   for the dtype, which must divide tile_k)
    accumulator      (tile_m/warp_m) * (tile_n/warp_n) / wave_size <= 256
                     f32 registers per lane (CACHE_MAX_ACC_REGS; above that
                     the kernel spills and is the slowest to compile)
    epilogue         default, cshuffle
    pipeline         mem, compv3, compv4, wavelet (wavelet: gfx1250 WMMA only;
                     "basic" is never cached -- it emits mem's code)

Per direction, on top of that:

* **fwd** -- vector widths: a = b in {1, 2, 4, 8} (X and W run along cpg),
  c in {1, 2, 4, 8} (Y along kpg). K loop: plain, ``unroll_k`` (double-
  buffered 2x loop), and ``async_dma`` (direct-to-LDS; built once per
  geometry, under pipeline "mem", since it ignores the pipeline).
* **wgrad** -- vector widths: a in {1, 2, 4, 8} (dY along kpg), b = c in
  {1, 2, 4, 8} (X and dW along cpg); with the default epilogue (all
  two-stage kernels) c = 1 and b in {1, 2, 4, 8}. pipeline "wavelet" is not cached (wgrad
  builds it as mem). Only the split-K kernel is cached (``split_k`` > 1,
  recorded as 2; the degree is a kernarg and the benchmark sweeps it at
  launch), as atomic or two-stage (f32 scratch + Stage-2 reduce,
  ``ws_replicas`` = 8). Plus group-merged depthwise kernels
  (``group_merge`` in 2..64, two-stage, load widths derived by the builder),
  served only to depthwise problems whose merged GEMM fits the tile.
* **dgrad** -- vector widths: a in {1, 2, 4, 8} (dY along kpg), b = c in
  {1, 2, 4, 8} (W and dX along cpg); with the default epilogue c = 1 and b in
  {1, 2, 4, 8}. stride and dilation are baked into the
  tilde decomposition, so they are capabilities: stride in {1, 2} x dilation
  in {1, 2}; up to 64 sub-GEMMs.

Every direction builds the grouped kernel only: it serves groups == 1 as well
(``CACHE_GROUPED``), so there is no separate ungrouped binary.

Not swept (spec defaults): ``lds_k_outer`` (off, so wgrad ``async_dma``, which
needs it, is never built), ``chiplet_swizzle``, ``lds_k_pad`` / ``lds_layout``,
``waves_per_eu``, accumulator epilogues, ``cshuffle_no_alias``, the wgrad
non-split (``split_k`` = 1) kernel, the pointwise fast path (1x1 problems run
the general kernels) and 3-D convolution. The direct-conv cache sweeps its own
grid: see :mod:`benchmarks.common.direct_kernel_sweep`.

    Shared by every kernel family: the family only decides which jobs exist
    and how one's kernel is built (``build(job, arch, dtype) -> (kernel,
    meta)``). Three steps:

    1. **Up to date.** An entry built from this process's emitter sources and
       COMGR, whose binary is present, is skipped outright -- after a rebuild
       with nothing changed, nothing below runs.
    2. **Emit** (cheap). Every remaining job is built and lowered to LLVM IR
       and keyed by :func:`comgr_input_key`, without compiling. A job whose
       key already has a binary is linked to it on the spot.
    3. **Compile** (expensive). The first job to emit a key with no binary
       compiles it, in the same process pool as the emits, as soon as its
       emit is done; every job with that key is linked when it lands. So
       after an emitter change only the kernels whose code changed are
       recompiled, identities that emit the same code share one compile, and
       an interrupted run keeps every entry it finished.

    A worker that dies outright (OOM kill, native crash in COMGR) breaks the
    pool: its in-flight jobs are rerun one per process, a job that kills its
    worker again is reported as failed, and the run goes on.
