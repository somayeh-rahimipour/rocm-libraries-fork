"""The AOT cache for the direct convolution kernels.

Direct conv splits its parameters differently from implicit GEMM. Batch,
spatial extents and the group count are kernargs, so one binary serves any
image; the filter geometry (``KH``/``KW``), ``stride``, ``PAD`` and the
per-group channel counts (``cpg``/``kpg``) shape the unrolled MFMA chain and
the LDS row layout, so they are *capabilities* baked into the binary. A cache
therefore holds one binary per (capability, tuning knob) pair, and
``--run-from-cache`` offers a binary only to problems with exactly its
capabilities.

Which capabilities to build is a product decision. :data:`DIRECT_CAPABILITIES`
follows the set the reference direct-conv library covers on CDNA and drops
what rocke's kernels cannot compute (see the table's comments).

The non-grouped (``groups == 1``) forward kernel bakes less: its channel counts
are kernargs as well, so its capabilities record ``cpg = kpg = 0`` (runtime)
and one binary serves every ``C``/``K`` its tile divides.

The run side is split in two. :func:`direct_plans` is pure CPU: it picks the
cached kernels that fit a problem, re-validates each spec against the real
shape, and returns a launch plan -- binaries, signatures, grids and the
buffer each kernarg slot binds to. The benchmark only allocates memory and
launches the plan.
