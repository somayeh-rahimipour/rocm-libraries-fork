"""Shared multi-engine sweep lane for the prefill live benchmarks.

Single source for the ``--variants sweep`` lane used by both the gfx942 and
gfx950 ``benchmark_prefill2d_live.py`` scripts. The lane was copy-pasted into
both benches and the copies had already diverged (one hard-crashed in the
summary, the other silently marked its own timings as errors); hoisting it here
means the timing, per-path record shape, and summary key handling stay identical
across arches and the next fix lands once.

    """Time every engine the dispatcher registry offers for this problem.

    Builds one :class:`~dispatch.attention.AttentionRequest`, calls
    :func:`~dispatch.attention.attention_sweep_space` (the deduped spec of every
    *supported* candidate), groups the offered engines by their launched path,
    and times each distinct path via ``run_unified_attention_torch``.

    The sweep space includes the opt-in tuning candidates. ``sweep_level``
    ``production`` (the default) walks the curated stacks. ``full`` samples
    every kernel knob: pass ``tuning_sample`` / ``seed`` (0 walks the full
    stream, millions of specs per shape on the transposed paths).
    ``candidate_prefix`` / ``tuning_id_prefix`` narrow one geometry or
    codepath, and ``limit`` caps how many specs are timed (0 = no cap).

    Returns a dict keyed by launched path. Each value is either a timed entry
    ``{"ms", "engines", "kernel", "out"}`` or -- if that one path raised --
    ``{"error", "engines"}``, so a failure on one path never discards the paths
    that already timed. An empty return means no candidate was eligible for the
    shape (the caller renders that as a visible marker, not a blank record).

    NOTE (framework phase): the registry decides the kernel *path* + candidate,
    not the CTA geometry (still owned by ``_tiled_spec_from_problem`` at launch).
    So distinct candidates that route to the same launched path collapse to one
    timed entry, which records the engine ``spec.name``s that mapped to it.
