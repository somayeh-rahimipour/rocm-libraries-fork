# Logical dtypes, storage, and operand packing

Matrix inputs and scales use three separate contracts:

1. A logical dtype identifies the numerical encoding and its bit width.
2. Bit packing describes how encoded patterns occupy bytes and carrier words.
3. An instruction fragment describes lane mapping, carrier capacity, and padding.

The selected atom determines supported operand combinations and instruction
selectors. An integer carrier does not identify the numerical format.

## Logical dtypes

[`dtype_info`](../../python/rocke/core/dtypes.py) and
[`rocke_dtype_info`](../../cpp/include/rocke/dtypes.h) return target-independent
encoding descriptors. `dtype_to_ir_type` and `rocke_dtype_to_ir_type` resolve
logical types, including distinct FP4 E2M1, FP6 E2M3, FP6 E3M2, E8M0, and E5M3.
`quant_ir_type` delegates type resolution to this common resolver.

Recognition and serialization do not enable scalar conversion, arithmetic, or
an instruction on a target. In this implementation, FP4/FP6, E8M0, and E5M3
are used in authoring metadata; storage helpers expand their transport into
existing integer operations before serialization. Raw scalar lowering of these
types remains unsupported. Existing FP16/BF16 and FP8/BF8 lowering is unchanged.

`e4m3` is an alias for the canonical `fp8e4m3` encoding, logical IR type, and
nominal FP8 storage pointer. Both spellings serialize as `fp8e4m3`. The
architecture scale selector `MmaScaleDType.E4M3` describes its operand role; it
does not introduce a second scalar type. Scale words can still be assembled
from raw byte patterns with the common bit packer.

Scale-format validation remains separate from matrix alias normalization:
E5M3 is not BF8 E5M2. Registering a scale dtype does not enable a backend selector.

Logical `tf32` (`xf32` alias) is a distinct 32-bit type carried as I32.
Fragment loading can reinterpret FP32 storage into I32 without conversion;
`bitcast` then wraps those bits as logical TF32. Explicit `cvt_f32_to_tf32`
performs RNE preparation. Packing itself never rounds. See the
[TF32 numerical example](../../python/rocke/examples/gfx942/tf32_numerics/README.md).

## Common packing

`BitPacking` / `rocke_bit_packing_t` describes unsigned bit patterns with an
encoded width and slot width. Dense packing uses equal widths. A wider slot has
unused high bits, which packers zero. The current encoding is least-significant
bit first in a little-endian byte stream.

| Format | Dense group occupying whole 32-bit words |
|---|---|
| TF32 | 1 element in 1 word |
| FP16/BF16 | 2 elements in 1 word |
| FP8/BF8 | 4 elements in 1 word |
| FP6/BF6 | 16 elements across 3 words |
| FP4 | 8 elements in 1 word |

FP6 elements can cross byte and word boundaries. Packing cannot be expressed
generally as `32 // element_bits` elements per word.

`FragmentPacking` / `rocke_fragment_packing_t` combines bit packing with a logical
count and a carrier width/count. Capacity is checked independently of payload
size; unused carriers are zero. Carriers may hold integer bits or typed values,
depending on the instruction ABI.

Host pack/unpack routines process bit patterns only. They do not round, clamp,
decode floats, or apply scales. Their tests use literal expected bits and
independent integer arithmetic; numerical tests remain separate.

## Fragment loads

[`storage_ir_type`](../../python/rocke/helpers/mma_io.py) chooses an addressable
unit from the logical dtype. FP4/FP6 use I8; FP8/BF8 retain their nominal pointer
types despite occupying one byte per value. This function is separate from
`dtype_to_ir_type`.

`load_matrix_fragment` takes a dtype, fragment layout, caller-selected row base,
lane group, and K origin. `row_base` counts pointer storage units. The optional
`alignment_bytes` (default 1) guarantees alignment at that row address, before
the loader adds K and lane/chunk offsets. For a buffer aligned to 16 bytes with
97-byte row spacing, arbitrary rows only guarantee alignment 1; a typed FP16
buffer with 258-byte row spacing guarantees alignment 2 and uses row offsets
in units of two bytes.

The loader checks dtype/packing width, pointer identity, whole-unit chunk and
origin alignment, carrier capacity, and static i32 displacement limits. It
reduces the supplied alignment for chunk spacing and K origin. A 24-byte FP6
chunk becomes 16-byte and 8-byte loads without reading past the chunk.
For byte-stored operands with i32 carriers, the loader selects up to four words
per load. It produces i32 vectors directly when every load has at least two
words. A 12-byte chunk produces three i32 lanes (`i32x3` in HIP), with the
original byte-address alignment. Address calculation remains in bytes, and the
loaded words concatenate into the operand fragment without intermediate byte
vectors. Typed chunks, partial words, and one-word tails retain their storage
element loads and final carrier bitcast when needed.

The existing `global_load_vN` and `smem_load_vN` builders also accept contiguous
96-bit payloads: twelve byte elements, six 16-bit elements, or three 32-bit
elements of their supported types. These loads default to element alignment;
HIP copies exactly twelve bytes, excluding vector-object padding. A single
96-bit machine instruction depends on target and alignment. This does not
change the fragment loader's chunk selection. FP6 transpose loads are deferred
until tensor-descriptor integration defines their lane/layout contract.

Tensor shape, strides, row selection, and allocation bounds belong to the
caller. This helper always loads a complete fragment: the caller must guard
empty or partial rows and provide a valid lane group. It is not a bounds-checked
tensor view. Existing `TensorDescriptor`/`TensorView` integration is deferred;
no separate tensor descriptor is introduced here.

`BitPacking(6)` describes dense FP6; `BitPacking(6, 8)` describes one six-bit
pattern per byte. Bit offsets and stream sizes are checked against uint64.
Host packers support partial tail bytes and write fresh, exclusively owned
buffers; concurrent packed stores are not provided.

## Matrix and scale layouts

`MatrixFragmentLayout` describes contiguous K chunks interleaved between lane
groups. Coordinate mapping belongs to the atom-specific layout, not to the
generic bit packer. This is a contiguous-K mapping, not a general matrix
distribution or a description of transposed axes and swizzled tensor addresses.
`ScaledWmmaOp.matrix_layout(operand)` selects independent
A/B layouts. Existing `a_frag_len`/`b_frag_len` retain their ABI-vector meaning.

The current gfx1250 scaled matrix layouts have 64 elements per lane and sixteen
i32 carriers. FP8 occupies all sixteen words. FP4 occupies eight and pads eight.
FP6 occupies twelve and pads four. The FP6 consumer adds homogeneous E2M3 and
E3M2 catalog entries with E8M0 scales; the packing descriptor alone does not
enable an instruction or numerical conversion.

`ScalePacking(count, block_k)` records how many source K elements share one
scale in `block_k` and exposes the byte layout through a shared `FragmentPacking`.
Scale association and bit layout remain separate properties of this contract.

Current scaled-WMMA scale fragments hold four eight-bit patterns in i32 for K32,
or eight in i64 for K16. The first K group occupies the low byte. The A/B scale
coordinate maps determine which scales each lane loads. The same
`pack_fragment_bits` helper can pack six-bit fields that cross word boundaries.
Its IR contract accepts encoded fields of at most 32 bits in i32 or i64 carriers;
wide encoded fields are outside the current operand requirements.

## Mirroring and follow-up work

The Python and C++ helpers expand descriptors before serialization. Their emitted
IR and HIP source are tested byte for byte, including FP16/BF16 typed carriers,
FP4/FP6/FP8 matrix payloads, and scale word packing. Existing GEMM signatures
remain compatible. HIP emits declarations for any encountered vector widths
absent from its fixed compatibility prologue.

The [FP6 GEMM builder](../../python/rocke/instances/gfx1250/block_scaled_gemm.py)
consumes the shared bit packing, matrix-fragment loader, and scale bit packer.
It owns row strides, bounds, and row alignment. Its E2M3/E3M2 numerical support
is specific to the selected gfx1250 atoms. FP4 is an independent consumer of
the same foundation; it is not a prerequisite for FP6. Target-independent
packing does not establish gfx950 numerical support.


First-class tensor-view/fragment IR nodes, arbitrary packed axes, masked partial
tiles, concurrent packed stores, and scalar low-bit conversions are separate
extensions. Any descriptor retained in future IR nodes must serialize, validate,
participate in cache keys, and have a native implementation.
