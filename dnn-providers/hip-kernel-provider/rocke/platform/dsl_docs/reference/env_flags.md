# Environment Variable Reference

Environment variables read by the CK DSL, its C++ engine, the hipDNN provider,
and the tooling, plus external compiler-runtime settings that affect rocKE.
The **core** flags are the ones most users need; other sections cover build/CI,
integration, external runtime settings, and experimental kernel-development knobs.
For setup and the most common flags in context, see
[`../development/setup_guide.md`](../development/setup_guide.md).

> Set on Linux with `export NAME=value`; on Windows with `set NAME=value`.

## Core engine

| Variable | Values (default) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ROCKE_BACKEND` | `cpp` \| `python` \| `both` (**cpp**) | Which engine lowers Python-authored kernels. `cpp` = C++ engine (auto-falls back to Python if `rocke_engine` isn't built); `python` = native lowerer; `both` = run both and assert byte-identical (the differential check). |
| `ROCKE_LLVM_FLAVOR` | `llvm22` \| `llvm20` \| `llvm23` (auto) | Force the LLVM IR flavor (datalayout/intrinsics). Auto-resolves from the **comgr lib that will actually load** (torch-bundled comgr 7.2 → `llvm22`; else `/opt/rocm` version, mapped ROCm `>= 7.13` → `llvm23`, `>= 7.2` → `llvm22`, else `llvm20`; default `llvm22`). `llvm23` (ROCm 7.13+) emits the same bytes as `llvm22` today — same datalayout, same declares — so it is a vintage label, not a third IR shape. **`llvm22` (ROCm 7.2) is the production backend and it MATERIALLY AFFECTS PERF** — MFMA scheduling and register allocation differ from `llvm20`, and some kernels (notably attention prefill bodies) that look register-bound / AGPR-spilled / occupancy-collapsed on `llvm20` are clean 2-WG/CU and far faster on `llvm22`. **Always benchmark on `llvm22`.** Import torch (or otherwise load comgr 7.2) FIRST so the right comgr is selected; forcing `llvm22` while the loaded comgr is 7.0/7.1 is rejected with a clean error (not a silent wrong-backend run). |
| `ROCKE_CPP_STRICT` | `1` (unset) | Make `cpp` backend **raise** instead of silently falling back to Python when `rocke_engine` is unavailable. |
| `ROCKE_DEBUG` | `1` (unset) | Verbose engine diagnostics during build/lowering. |
| `ROCKE_DEBUG_LOC` | `1` (unset) | Record the Python call stack behind every op while the kernel builds, and lower it to DWARF inlining scopes, so an ATT trace maps instructions back to the source that authored them. Off by default for two reasons: it costs a stack walk per op (material on sweeps that build thousands of kernels), and populating `op.loc` **changes the emitted `.ll` bytes**, so the byte-identity gate and the IR goldens run without it. The added metadata does not change the generated ISA, so a trace captured with it on is still representative. `IRBuilder(capture_loc=True)` is the per-builder equivalent. Set it on the process that **builds** the kernel, not on the compiler; [`capture_wavescope_trace.py`](../optimization/utilities/tools/wavescope/capture_wavescope_trace.py) does that and the rest of the capture in one command. The same DWARF is what lets `rocgdb` name the authoring line behind a memory fault — see [`../development/debugging_rocgdb.md`](../development/debugging_rocgdb.md). |
| `ROCKE_TIME` | `1` (unset) | Print phase timings for the build/lower/compile pipeline. |
| `ROCKE_USE_SUDO` | `1` (unset) | Benchmark/sweep harness launches kernels via `sudo -n -E` (for boxes where the user lacks GPU device-group access). |

## GEMM dispatch

| Variable | Values (default) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ROCKE_GEMM_SPLIT_K` | `auto` \| `off` \| `<n>` (**auto**) | Split-K degree for CDNA UniversalGemm dispatch. `auto` runs the selection heuristic (engages split-K only for skinny / tall-N decode shapes whose grid leaves the CU-rich device idle; `1` for shapes that already fill it, keeping the default/square path byte-identical). `off` (or `0`/`1`) forces split-K disabled. `<n>` (>= 2) forces that degree, snapped down to the largest factor that evenly slices K. When engaged, the dispatcher launches a `(N_tiles, M_tiles, split_k)` grid and the caller must zero-init an f32 `[M, N]` workspace before launch and cast it back to the output dtype after. |

## hipDNN provider

| Variable | Values (default) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ROCKE_C_JIT` | `1` (unset) | Provider generates kernels from C source at runtime (C-JIT) instead of loading prebuilt HSACOs. |
| `ROCKE_PROVIDER_C_JIT` | CMake `ON`/`OFF` (**ON**) | Build-time switch compiling the provider's C-JIT path. Pair with `-DROCKE_LIB=<librocke_core.a>` (or build the engine fresh). Runtime use still requires `ROCKE_C_JIT=1`. |
| `HIPDNN_ENABLE_SDPA` | CMake `ON`/`OFF` (**OFF**) | Build-time hipDNN option. **REQUIRED (ON) for any SDPA/attention graph** — the SDPA frontend is `#ifdef`-compiled-out otherwise. The hipDNN SDK at `HIPDNN_ROOT` AND the provider must BOTH be built with it, or the SDPA plan silently DECLINEs. |
| `ROCKE_ALLOW_ENGINE_MISMATCH` | `1` (unset) | Downgrade the engine build-id freshness check from a hard error to a warning on a stale/mismatched kernel bundle (default: fail loudly). |
| `ROCKE_KERNEL_LIB_PATH` | path (unset) | Directory of the prebuilt HSACO kernel bundle the provider loads (Fast mode); leave empty to force C-JIT. |
| `ROCKE_ML_MODEL_DIR` | path (unset) | Directory of the ML heuristic models used for kernel selection. |
| `HIPDNN_PLUGIN_PATH` | path (unset) | Where hipDNN locates the rocke-provider plugin. |

## Tooling, CI & remote

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ROCKE_PARITY_BUILD` / `ROCKE_PARITY_EMIT` | The binding-parity harness's `.so` dir and prebuilt-emitter dir — **must be the same fresh build** (mixing reports false mismatches). |
| `ROCKE_PARITY_ALLOW_STALE` | Allow the parity harness to run with a build-id mismatch (debug only). |
| `ROCKE_CI_RUN_DIR` | Out-of-tree directory for local/cluster CI runs (keeps build products off the source tree). |
| `ROCKE_ROOT` | Override the detected repository root. |
| `ROCKE_REMOTE_HOST` / `ROCKE_REMOTE_USER` / `ROCKE_REMOTE_KEY` / `ROCKE_REMOTE_STAGE` | Multi-arch remote-test orchestrator: SSH host/user/key and the staging dir. |
| `ROCKE_SLURM_EXTRA` | Extra SLURM flags appended by the multi-arch submitter. |
| `ROCKE_DOCKER_IMAGE` / `ROCKE_DOCKER_EXTRA_FLAGS` | Container image and extra flags for containerized runs. |
| `ROCM_PATH` | ROCm install prefix override (when not `/opt/rocm`). |
| `LLVM_OBJDUMP` / `LLVM_READELF` | Paths to the LLVM tools the ISA/resource probes shell out to. |

## External compiler runtime

These settings are consumed by COMGR or supporting runtime components, rather
than parsed as rocKE options. Their defaults and availability are determined by
the loaded COMGR/toolchain version and the operating system.

| Variable | Values / purpose |
|---|---|
| `AMD_COMGR_CACHE_DIR` | Path to COMGR's persistent compilation cache. On clusters with NFS-backed home directories, select a writable node-local directory to avoid synchronous cache metadata access over NFS. |
| `AMD_COMGR_CACHE` | Set to `0` to disable COMGR caching for diagnosis. Repeated compilations then lose persistent cache hits; prefer relocating the cache to node-local storage for normal use. |
| `TMPDIR` | On Unix-like systems, selects the temporary-file directory for components that honor it. Use a writable node-local directory for compilation jobs. This does not relocate the persistent COMGR cache. |

Create the cache and temporary directories before launching the compilation
process, and set these variables in the environment inherited by its workers.
Workers on the same node can share the job's COMGR cache to retain cache reuse.
A fresh job-local cache starts without entries from previous jobs; choose its
lifetime according to the desired reuse and the site's scratch-storage policy.

COMGR also reads ROCm/HIP metadata and toolchain inputs. If those paths are on
NFS, relocating the cache alone may leave filesystem stalls. When using a
locally staged ROCm installation, point `ROCM_PATH` and `HIP_PATH` at that
installation and ensure the loaded COMGR library, compiler inputs, temporary
files, and outputs use the intended local paths. Disabling the COMGR cache does
not disable these other filesystem accesses.

## Case-study-specific flags

Some flags are specific to one example/case study and are documented there, not
here: the `ATOM_USE_DSL_GEMM` / `ATOM_USE_DSL_ATTENTION` / `ATOM_DSL_GEMM_MAX_M`
/ `ATOM_DSL_GEMM_DEBUG` torch.compile-routing flags live in
`examples/gfx950/qwen3_30b_a3b/README.md`, and `AITER_PATH` (an external-baseline
checkout) is documented in the example READMEs that use it (e.g.
`examples/gfx950/attention/README.md`, `examples/gfx950/moe/README.md`).

## Experimental kernel-development knobs (off by default)

These tune or diagnose specific kernel paths. **Leave unset** unless you are
working on that path; they are read at the relevant builder/instance and several
are diagnostics that intentionally change emission. None affect the default build.

For an unlisted variable, check its reader and documentation before assuming its
default or stability. It may be an internal experimental knob or a setting owned
by an external library or tool.
