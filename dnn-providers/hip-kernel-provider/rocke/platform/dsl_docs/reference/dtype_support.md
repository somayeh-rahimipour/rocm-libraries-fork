**What this is.** A source-backed record of which data types rocKE supports, at
which layer, and what each gap consists of. It covers the **compiler** (the two
byte-identical LLVM-IR engines), the **helpers** (conversions / I/O / quantization),
the **kernel families**, and the **hardware ceiling** the families sit under.

**Scope.** This document records implementation coverage. Priorities, effort
estimates, shipping order, and acceptance checklists are maintained separately.

| **Basis** | Source review against `develop` at [26b228bb57890bb9a2016d0c8d5d55eaa1b4b1ef](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/commit/26b228bb57890bb9a2016d0c8d5d55eaa1b4b1ef), 2026-09-17. Every `file:line` anchor and both §4B atom tables are valid against **that tree**; public ISA XML checked 2026-09-23. **Re-verify after any rebase that advances the base** — see "Keeping it current". |
| **Method** | Source inspection of both engines, comparison with public ISA XML and pinned LLVM sources, and Python host-side checks of the block-scale GEMM validator, signature, and IR parameters. Scores use §2.2's criteria and §2.6's source anchors. No GPU execution or numerical validation. Silicon claims come from [`matrix_instructions_summary.md`](./matrix_instructions_summary.md); declared atoms come from [arch_specs.json](../../python/rocke/core/arch/data/arch_specs.json). |
| **Out of scope** | Runtime/dispatch dtype validation, the provider's C-api surface, and any measurement. |
| **Keeping it current** | When a dtype's support changes at any layer, update the affected row(s) and the §2.6 anchors in the same change. The criteria (§2.2) and rubric (§2.3) are the stable part; the scores are not. **Line anchors and the §4B atom tables are hand-maintained mirrors of the basis tree and go stale on rebase** — an arch entry gaining or losing atoms upstream silently invalidates §4B without touching this file. Re-check both against the new base before merging any rebase. |

**TF32 coverage update.** The TF32 entries in §1, §4B, and §4D reflect the
logical dtype and native gfx942 atoms added after the original basis snapshot.
Other scores and source line numbers retain their stated historical basis.

## 1. The canonical dtype set

The original basis snapshot listed ten scalar IR types. The table below also
includes the subsequently added logical TF32 type. For the newer logical
low-bit and scale types, see [dtype storage and packing](../architecture/dtype_storage_packing.md).
The definitions in both engines are:

- Python: `platform/python/rocke/core/ir.py:43-52`
- C++: `platform/cpp/include/rocke/ir.h:93-108`,
  `platform/cpp/core/ir/core_types.cpp:47-56`

| IR name | LLVM-IR type | Bits | Family |
|---|---|---|---|
| `i1` | `i1` | 1 | int / predicate |
| `i8` | `i8` | 8 | int |
| `i16` | `i16` | 16 | int |
| `i32` | `i32` | 32 | int |
| `i64` | `i64` | 64 | int |
| `f16` | `half` | 16 | float |
| `bf16` | `bfloat` | 16 | float |
| `f32` | `float` | 32 | float |
| `tf32` | `i32` (carrier) | 32 | logical float; native gfx942 XF32 input |
| `fp8e4m3` | `i8` (storage) | 8 | float (OCP E4M3) |
| `bf8e5m2` | `i8` (storage) | 8 | float (OCP E5M2) |

LLVM mapping: `lower_llvm.py:1093-1129` (Python, `_llvm_type`) ↔
`cpp/core/lower_llvm/core.cpp:938-994` (C++). FP8/BF8 are carried as `i8`
storage and materialized through `llvm.amdgcn.cvt.*` intrinsics — there is no
native `<8 x fp8>` LLVM type in the emitter.

**Sub-byte / block formats in the original snapshot.** The basis tree treated
`i4`, `fp4`, `fp6`, and the `e8m0` MX scale as packed encodings consumed by
dedicated helpers/atoms. Those historical scores do not describe the newer
logical-type and storage APIs linked above.

**TF32 is a logical dtype with a 32-bit I32 carrier.** `tf32` and its `xf32`
alias select two native gfx942 XF32 atoms independently of ordinary FP32
selection. The logical type survives serialization; only A/B are bitcast to
the intrinsic's float-vector ABI, while C/D remain FP32.

`bitcast(value, TF32)` wraps an FP32 or I32 payload without rounding.
`cvt_f32_to_tf32(value)` explicitly prepares FP32 inputs with round-to-nearest,
ties-to-even; bitcasting back to F32 reinterprets the prepared bits. Generic
TF32 scalar and vector arithmetic is rejected. Bitcasts, vector transport,
selection, and the native atoms are supported. Direct global vector loads
accept 2, 3, 4, or 8 TF32 elements; global vector stores accept 1, 2, 4, or 8.
Both use the same alignment rules as I32. Payload width and address alignment
are independent: underaligned HIP stores copy exactly the payload bytes, and
target/alignment determine the machine transfer instructions.
The fragment loader uses `storage_ir_type("tf32") == I32` and returns carriers
that the caller wraps as logical TF32.

Native XF32 is available on gfx942, but absent on gfx950 and gfx1250 (§4D).
Production GEMM/convolution selectors and cross-target TF32 emulation remain
outside this support. The [numerical probe](../../python/rocke/examples/gfx942/tf32_numerics/README.md)
covers raw payloads, explicit RNE preparation, and ordinary FP32 controls.

A **BF16 compute mode over `f32` storage** could convert operands to `bf16` and
use existing bf16 MFMA/WMMA atoms. Its precision differs from TF32: the reference
TF32 form keeps **10** mantissa bits (`truncateToTf32()` zeroes the bottom 13 bits
of an `f32`, `GpuRefTypes.h:92-103`, gated by `USE_TF32`), while `bf16` keeps
**7**. For example, `1.0009765625` survives that TF32 truncation but rounds to
`1.0` in bf16. Widening validation tolerances does not make these contracts
equivalent; `USE_TF32` output is not a bit-accuracy oracle for BF16 compute.

The matrix below therefore labels this possible mode `bf16-mode`. It is separate
from logical TF32; no production selector maps TF32 requests to BF16 compute.

**Types that are entirely absent from the vocabulary:** `f64`, unsigned
`u8/u16/u32/u64`, and a distinct `bool` (predicates reuse `i1`). No engine
references them.

TF32 source anchors: [Python type and builders](../../python/rocke/core/ir.py),
[native type declarations](../../cpp/include/rocke/ir.h),
[Python contracts](../../python/rocke/core/tf32.py), and
[native contracts](../../cpp/include/rocke/tf32_internal.h).

## 2. Coverage matrix — support status by layer

### 2.1 Why explicit criteria

A per-layer verdict of Full / Partial / Absent is not enough on its own: it never
says *what makes a layer Full*, so two "Partial" types cannot be compared against
each other. §2.2 therefore names six **support criteria**, each with the external
requirement it is derived from; §2.4 scores every dtype against them.

The criteria are chosen so that each one is (a) independently observable in the
source, and (b) traceable to a requirement from one of three ecosystems:
**Composable Kernel** (the reference for what a mature AMD kernel library supports
per dtype), **hipDNN** (the descriptor/graph interface rocKE must honor — its
`data_objects::DataType` enum is the contract), and **MIOpen** (the incumbent
provider whose accepted dtype set defines the must-not-regress floor).

### 2.2 The six support criteria (C1–C6)

| # | Criterion | What it asks | Rationale — where the requirement comes from |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C1** | **IR representability** | Is the dtype a first-class `Type` in *both* engines, byte-identically? | hipDNN's `DataType` enum and CK's named C++ types provide logical type identities. C1 measures first-class representation in rocKE's IR, separately from physical storage. Dedicated helpers and atoms can support packed formats with C1=0; C2–C6 are assessed independently. |
| **C2** | **Compute + MMA lowering** | Can the emitter lower arithmetic on it, and does a matrix atom (MFMA/WMMA) accept it on some target arch? | This is the difference between "storable" and "fast." CK dispatches its xdlops/wmma pipelines per dtype; MIOpen's conv solvers are keyed by dtype for the same reason. A dtype with no atom can only ever be a storage/epilogue type, which caps every downstream family. |
| **C3** | **Conversion completeness** | Are casts to **and** from the `f32` hub present, plus the direct sibling casts that avoid a double bounce, with correct rounding/saturation? | Every hipDNN plan in this repo asserts `computeDataType() == DataType::FLOAT` (SDPA, RMSNorm, batchnorm, resample), so *every* tensor dtype must round-trip through f32 or it cannot participate. CK's `type_convert<Dst,Src>` is deliberately **total** over its type set; partial conversion coverage is the single most common way a dtype is "supported" on paper but unusable in a fusion. |
| **C4** | **Memory I/O plumbing** | Scalar load/store, vectorised (`n∈{2,4,8}`) load/store, and pack/unpack at the helper surface — not just raw IR primitives. | A tensor dtype is only usable if a kernel can move it. CK exposes `buffer_load`/`buffer_store` at every vector width for each supported type; rocKE's equivalent is `helpers/io.py`. If `io.py` raises `ValueError` on a dtype, every small-op family (norm, reduce, elementwise, transpose) is closed to it regardless of what the compiler can express. |
| **C5** | **Kernel-family reach** | How many shipping families actually accept it — GEMM, MFMA-GEMM, conv, attention, norm/quant epilogues? | This is the criterion the *user* feels. The reference set is the hipDNN op surface this provider implements: conv fwd/bwd/wgrad, SDPA fwd/bwd, batchnorm, RMSNorm, resample, matmul. A dtype that passes C1–C4 but ships in zero instances delivers nothing. |
| **C6** | **Numerical / dialect hygiene** | Is rounding + saturation defined, and is the *encoding dialect* unambiguous at the arch boundary? | gfx942 fp8 uses **FNUZ** and gfx950 fp8 uses **OCP**; a dialect mismatch can silently change decoded values. Classic CK distinguishes dialects by type; CK-Tile selects them through build-configured numeric traits and passes those traits to internal conversions (§4E). Neither an internal selector nor a shared storage type alone establishes a safe caller contract. rocKE's score reflects the incomplete validation of that contract across families. MX formats also require an explicit scale contract: E8M0 scales are powers of two. |

Not every criterion applies to every dtype. For `i1`, `i16`, and `i64`, this
matrix assesses predicate/index/address storage and use: `C2` (matrix arithmetic),
`C3` (float conversions), and `C6` (rounding/dialect) are **N/A**. Their integer
operations do not imply that an MMA atom accepts those types. `i32` is also a
matrix accumulator/output type, so its `C2` and `C3` are assessed; `C6` remains
N/A for exact integer arithmetic. `i8` is assessed as quantized matrix input,
including conversion rounding and saturation, so all six criteria apply.

### 2.3 Scoring rubric

Each criterion is scored **0–3**. `N/A` criteria are dropped from both the
numerator and the denominator. `Support% = 100 × sum(scores) / (3 × number of
applicable criteria)`, rounded to the nearest integer. It describes only the
applicable criteria; percentages for indexing types and matrix inputs do not
measure the same capabilities.

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **3 — Full** | No constraint a kernel author would hit. |
| **2 — Mostly** | Works, with a documented constraint or an extra step (e.g. an obligatory `f32` bounce, a generic rather than dedicated primitive). |
| **1 — Partial** | Exists in one direction / one surface / one arch only; a kernel author must route around it. |
| **0 — Absent** | Not available at this layer at all. |

**What the scores are not.** `Support%` measures *implementation coverage in this
tree*, nothing else. It carries no judgement about how much a gap matters, how
much effort closing it would take, or when it should be closed — those are
planning questions and deliberately live outside this document (see
"Scope" at the top). A 0% row is not automatically more urgent than a
94% row.

> Source references use repository-relative paths. CK resides under
> `projects/composablekernel`; references distinguish classic CK (`include/ck/`)
> from CK-Tile (`include/ck_tile/`), particularly where their FP8 dialect models
> differ.

### 2.4 Scored matrix

Scores 0–3 per criterion; `—` = N/A (excluded from the denominator). Rows are
grouped by type family, not ranked — see "What the scores are not" in §2.3.
TF32 was added after this scored snapshot; its current layer boundaries are
described in §1 and §4D rather than assigned a retrospective percentage here.

Gap categories: **[C]** conversion gap · **[P]** partial/plumbing gap ·
**[M]** missing entirely.

| dtype | C1 IR | C2 MMA | C3 cvt | C4 I/O | C5 family | C6 numeric | Support% | Gap cat. |

`bf16-mode` measures a possible compute mode over `f32` storage. Its scores
credit the existing storage, casts, and bf16 atoms; they do not imply a callable
mode. The missing selector and precision contract are described in §2.5.

### 2.5 Score justifications (why each non-3 was assigned)

- **`f16` / `bf16` C3=2** — the only conversion missing is the *direct*
  `f16 ↔ bf16` cast; today it costs two casts through `f32`. Everything else
  round-trips. `bf16` reaches the same score as `f16` despite using the generic
  `global_load_vN(ptr, idx, BF16, n)` where `f16` has a dedicated
  `global_load_vN_f16` — same capability, different opcode spelling, so C4=3
  for both.
- **`fp8e4m3` / `bf8e5m2` C3=1** — `↔f32` only. No `→f16`, `→bf16`, or `→i8`,
  which is exactly the cast a mixed-precision attention inner loop wants.
- **`fp8e4m3` / `bf8e5m2` C4=1** — packed output helpers are available.
  `pack_quant_chunk_f32` (`io.py:260-297`) accepts `fp8`, `fp8e4m3`, `bf8`,
  `bf8e5m2`, and `i8`, emits `cvt_pk_{fp8,bf8,i8}_f32x4`, and supplies the result
  to `store_packed_chunk` (`io.py:300-315`). The generic `load_scalar`, `load_vec`,
  `store_scalar`, `store_vec`, and `pack_f32_to` helpers reject FP8/BF8 through
  `io_ir_type` (`io.py:51-62`). Coverage is limited to packed output.
- **`fp8e4m3` / `bf8e5m2` C5=1** — present in block-scale GEMM A/B, MoE-fp8, and
  attention K/V, but **absent from universal GEMM** (`gemm_universal.py:659`
  raises `NotImplementedError` for any dtype that is not `F16`/`BF16`) and from
  MFMA GEMM, whose `_SUPPORTED_DTYPES` (`mfma_gemm.py:178`) is `("f16","bf16")`
  and which rejects anything else at `:192-195`.
- **`fp8*` C6=1** — the FNUZ/OCP split is guarded only in the attention path;
  nothing generalizes it, so the same bytes can silently mis-decode elsewhere.
- **`fp8 fnuz` C1=1** — it shares `i8` storage with OCP fp8 and has no distinct
  IR type or caller-visible dialect selector. Lowering resolves the dialect from
  the target. Within the target set in §4E, gfx942 uses FNUZ and gfx950/gfx1250
  use OCP. §4E also describes CK's type-based and CK-Tile's build-based selection.
  **C4=1** for the same reason as OCP fp8: fnuz shares the `i8` storage and the
  same `pack_quant_chunk_f32` path, whose `qdtype` distinguishes `fp8`/`bf8`/`i8`
  but not the dialect.
- **`i8` C2=2** — full integer arithmetic and an `iu8` WMMA atom exists on
  gfx1151, but no CDNA integer MFMA path is wired *in rocKE*. Note the ceiling is
  software, not silicon: `V_MFMA_I32_*_I8` ships on every CDNA generation
  including gfx942 and gfx950 (§4A), and gfx950 adds K64/K32 wide forms.
  **C3=2** — both directions through f32 exist in
  [quant.py](../../python/rocke/helpers/quant.py): `quantize_scalar_f32` uses
  RNE with a symmetric ±127 clamp, and `dequantize_scalar_to_f32` handles
  i8→i32→f32 internally. Use `scale=b.const_f32(1.0)` for an unscaled conversion; callers
  do not need to write the extension themselves. Direct sibling conversions
  still route through f32, so this remains Mostly rather than Full.
  **C5=1** — quant epilogues and the gfx1151 integer WMMA GEMM instances in §5
  exist. Matrix-family reach remains limited to targets with the `iu8` WMMA
  atom and packed-input builders; universal/MFMA GEMM and attention do not
  expose i8.
  **C6=2 — `i8` is the one integer row where C6 applies.** Unlike `i32`/`i16`/
  `i64`, `i8` here is a *quantized* type with a real numeric contract: rounding
  is RNE and saturation is a symmetric ±127 clamp (`quant.py:66-70,141-204`), and
  it sits in the same `QDType` union as `fp8e4m3`/`bf8e5m2` (`io.py:58`). It is 2
  rather than 3 because the scale semantics are not part of the contract — the
  helpers take a scale operand but neither document nor enforce per-tensor vs
  per-channel, so two callers can disagree about what a scale means.
- **`i4` C1=0 / C3=1** — packed i4 is not a scalar IR `Type`.
  [i4_dequant.py](../../python/rocke/helpers/i4_dequant.py) provides conversions
  from packed i4 to i32, f32, f16, fp8, and bf8, but no reverse f32→packed-i4
  conversion. The quantization helpers accept only i8, fp8, and bf8
  (`quant.py:58-70`). This is one-direction support under C3's round-trip
  criterion. C2=1 reflects `iu4` WMMA on gfx1151/gfx11-generic; the MFMA targets
  and gfx1250 have no native INT4 matrix instruction (§4A).
- **`fp4` / `fp6` / `bf6` C5=0** — the widest silicon-to-software gap in the
  matrix. The gfx950 atoms exist (`mfma_f32_16x16x128_fp4`,
  `mfma_f32_16x16x96_fp6`) and the hipBLASLt provider already maps
  `FP4_E2M1`→`HIP_R_4F_E2M1` and `FP6_E3M2`→`HIP_R_6F_E3M2`, so the interface and
  the silicon are both ready — but **no rocKE kernel instance ships**.
- **`fp4` C3=1** — `unpack_fp4_byte_to_pair_f32` (`i4_dequant.py:251`) decodes a
  packed byte to two f32 via a hand-written 16-entry codebook
  (`_FP4_CODEBOOK`, `:214-232`) that matches OCP E2M1
  (`±{0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6}`). Partial rather than Full because there is no
  scalar `cvt` primitive and no f32→fp4 direction.
- **`fp6` (E2M3) C3=0 — there is no E2M3 decoder at all.** Despite the name,
  `unpack_fp6_bytes_to_quad_f32` (`i4_dequant.py:308`) does not implement E2M3;
  see the next entry.
- **`bf6` (E3M2) C3=0 — a decoder exists but is defective and must not be used.**
  `_FP6_CODEBOOK` (`i4_dequant.py:276-287`) is built as
  `2^(e-3) × (1 + m/4)` over a 3-bit exponent (bias 3) and a 2-bit mantissa, which
  is **E3M2 — i.e. `bf6`, not `fp6`** (CK-Tile is explicit about the split:
  `pk_fp6_t = pk_float6_e2m3_t` and `pk_bf6_t = pk_float6_e3m2_t`,
  `include/ck_tile/core/numeric/pk_f6.hpp:294-295,300-323`). It carries three
  independent defects and is scored 0 for that reason:
  1. **Width.** The entry point takes two `i8` operands = 16 bits, but four
     6-bit values need 24. `v2` is silently truncated (its top two bits read as
     zero) and `v3` is always code 0.
  2. **Zero and subnormal encoding.** Codes 0 and 32 map to `+1.0` and `-1.0`
     instead of signed zero. Nonzero subnormal codes collapse to signed zero.
  3. **Naming.** The public symbol says `fp6` while the layout is `bf6`, so a
     caller following OCP naming gets the other format with no error.
  Fixing this needs a signature change (three `i8`, or one `i32`), a corrected
  codebook, a rename to `unpack_bf6_*`, and a genuine `unpack_fp6_*` for E2M3.
  Tracked outside this document; until then neither format has a usable decode.
- **`e8m0` C1=0 / C6=2** — a scale operand rather than a type, and
  `cvt_scalef32_pk_*` restricts scales to powers of two; arbitrary scaling needs
  an unscaled cvt plus an explicit `fmul`.
- **`i1` C4=1** — predicates work, but there is no zero-vector primitive
  (guarded), so vector-width predicate init must be open-coded.
- **`i64` C4=1** — 8-byte LDS works and addressing is fine, but there is no
  `global_store_vN` and no zero-vec. It is an addressing type with no matrix atom.
- **`u8` — 0 at every layer.** `UINT8` appears in the hipDNN enum
  (`GpuReferenceValidationFactory.cpp:31`), but only in a reference-validation
  switch; no rocKE surface accepts it. Note that the silicon is not the
  constraint: the RDNA/GFX12 WMMA integer atom is `IU8`, whose per-operand
  signedness selects make it an *unsigned* int8 matmul as well as a signed one
  (§4A).
- **`bf16-mode` C1=0 / C5=0** — no spec knob, dtype string, or compile define
  selects this mode. Its building blocks exist: f32 storage (C4=3),
  `cast_f32_to(v, BF16)` (C3=2), and bf16 MFMA/WMMA atoms (C2=3).
  **C6=1** records the need for a caller-visible BF16 precision contract when
  the mode is exposed; see [§1](#1-the-canonical-dtype-set).
- **`f64` / `u16-64` — 0 at every layer.** Absent from the hipDNN enum, rejected
  by the MIOpen provider, and not requested by any family. For `f64` specifically
  `V_MFMA_F64_*` is present on gfx90a/gfx942/gfx950, where f64 is unwired
  software. gfx1250 has no F64 matrix instruction: LLVM gates
  `V_WMMA_F64_16X16X4_F64` on `gfx1251-gemm-insts` (§4A).

## 3. Conversion coverage (helpers layer)

`f32` is the universal hub; every quantized/reduced type converts through it.
Documented conversion **gaps** (the "partially supported (missing conversions)"
bucket the ticket calls out):

| Missing / constrained conversion | Current workaround | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `f16 ↔ bf16` (direct) | route via `f32` (2 casts) | [C] |
| `fp8e4m3/bf8e5m2 → f16` and `→ bf16` | dequant to `f32`, then cast | [C] |
| `fp8/bf8 → i8` (and reverse) | via `f32` | [C] |
| `f32 → packed i4` | No quantization/packing helper; the existing `i4_dequant.py` helpers only convert out of i4. | [C] |
| `fp8/bf8` in `io.py` `load_scalar`/`store_scalar`/`pack_f32_to` | raises `ValueError`; must use IR primitives or `quant.py` | [P] |
| `sitofp_f32` primitive from `i8/i16` | Primitive accepts i32 only. For signed i8, use [quant.py](../../python/rocke/helpers/quant.py) `dequantize_scalar_to_f32(b, x, scale=b.const_f32(1.0))`; it emits sext + sitofp internally. For signed i16, explicitly sext to i32 first. | [P] |
| MX scaled cvt (`cvt_scalef32_pk_*`) | E8M0 scale only → **power-of-two scales**; arbitrary scale needs unscaled cvt + `fmul` | [P] |
| packed store `store_packed_chunk_local` | `n∈{4,8}` only (no `n=2`); `load_vec`/`store_vec` `n∈{2,4,8}` | [P] |
| scalar `cvt_fp4_to_f32` | No dedicated scalar cvt primitive. [i4_dequant.py](../../python/rocke/helpers/i4_dequant.py) `unpack_fp4_byte_to_pair_f32` (`:251`) decodes E2M1 from a 16-entry codebook (`:214-232`) without MFMA, and is correct. | [P] |
| scalar `cvt_fp6_to_f32` / `cvt_bf6_to_f32` | **No usable decoder.** Do not use `unpack_fp6_bytes_to_quad_f32` for either format; its width, codebook, and naming defects are detailed in [§2.5](#25-score-justifications-why-each-non-3-was-assigned). | [P][C] |
| stochastic rounding (any quant) | not implemented ("v2 follow-on") | [M] |

Rounding/saturation that **is** present: round-to-nearest-even + saturating
clamp for all `f32→{i8,fp8e4m3,bf8e5m2}` (`quant.py:141-204`, `ir.py:1128-1139`);
clamp magnitudes `i8=127`, `fp8e4m3=448`, `bf8e5m2=57344` (`quant.py:66-70`).

## 4. Hardware atom → dtype support (the hardware ceiling)

This section separates three different things that are easy to conflate: what the
**silicon** provides (§4A), what **rocKE declares** it can use (§4B), and the
**deltas** between them (§4C). §4D and §4E then take the two arch-boundary issues
that recur throughout this document — XF32/TF32 and the FP8 encoding dialect — and
state them once in full.

Nothing in §4A was measured. It is transcribed from the per-architecture AMD ISA
documentation via [`matrix_instructions_summary.md`](./matrix_instructions_summary.md);
for any specific instruction, refer to the official AMD ISA document for the
corresponding architecture.

### 4A. Silicon capability (per the per-arch AMD ISA documentation)

| Arch | ISA gen | Engine | f32 | f16 | bf16 | fp8/bf8 | i8 | i4 | fp4/fp6 | MX scale | f64 | XF32 (TF32) | Sparse |
|---|---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| gfx90a | CDNA2 | MFMA | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (1K) | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| gfx942 | CDNA3 | MFMA + SMFMAC | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ **FNUZ** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | **✅ only here** | ✅ |
| gfx950 | CDNA4 | MFMA + SMFMAC | ✅ | ✅ (+K-packed) | ✅ (+K-packed) | ✅ **OCP** | ✅ (+K64) | ❌ | ✅ `F8F6F4` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ removed | ✅ |
| gfx1151 | RDNA3.5 | WMMA | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ `iu8` | ✅ `iu4` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| gfx1201 | RDNA4 | WMMA + SWMMAC | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `iu8` | ✅ `iu4` (+K32) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| gfx1250 | CDNA5 | WMMA + SWMMAC | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (K64/K128) | ✅ `iu8` | ❌ † | ✅ `F8F6F4` + `F4` | ✅ (+block-16) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

† Integer matrix on gfx1250 is **`iu8`-only**: `V_WMMA_I32_16X16X64_IU8` and
`V_SWMMAC_I32_16X16X128_IU8`. Two independent complete enumerations agree that no
`IU4` form exists there — the ISA document's dense opcode table, and LLVM's
contiguous gfx1250 real-instruction block (`0x033`, `0x05b`–`0x088`), which carries
`IU8` at `0x072`/`0x07b` while every `IU4` definition in LLVM is gated to the
RDNA3/RDNA3.5/RDNA4 classes. gfx1201 is the last architecture in this table with
i4 matrix support.

The ISA labels and instruction evidence follow the public AMD XML files linked
in [the ISA reference](./matrix_instructions_summary.md#sources-and-reproduction).
The gfx1250 source is `amdgpu_isa_cdna5.xml`; rocKE classifies the target as
`family: "cdna"`, `target_family: "gfx12_cdna"` (wave32, WMMA, no MFMA).
F64 WMMA is absent from that XML; the pinned LLVM target predicates restrict it
to gfx1251, so this is not a missing gfx1250 atom.

### 4B. What rocKE declares — the atom catalog

`core/arch/data/arch_specs.json` is rocKE's architecture SSOT. An atom that is not
declared there is unusable by any kernel regardless of what the silicon provides.
The original basis snapshot, with the gfx942 XF32 addition noted below:

| Arch | Declared matrix atoms | dtypes reachable |
|---|---|---|
| `gfx90a` | `mfma_f32_{16x16x16,32x32x8}_{f16,bf16}` | f16, bf16 |
| `gfx942` | the gfx90a set + `mfma_f32_{16x16x4,32x32x2}_f32` + `mfma_f32_{16x16x32,32x32x16}_{fp8,bf8}` + `mfma_f32_{16x16x8,32x32x4}_xf32` | f32, f16, bf16, fp8, bf8, **tf32** |
| `gfx950` | the gfx942 set **excluding XF32** + K-packed `{16x16x32,32x32x16}_{f16,bf16}` + `mfma_f32_16x16x128_fp4` + `mfma_f32_16x16x96_fp6` | f32, f16, bf16, fp8, bf8, **fp4, fp6** |
| `gfx1151` | `wmma_f32_16x16x16_{f16,bf16}`, `wmma_i32_16x16x16_{iu8,iu4}` | f16, bf16, **iu8, iu4** |
| `gfx1201` | `wmma_gfx12_f32_16x16x16_{f16,bf16}` | f16, bf16 |
| `gfx1250` | `wmma_gfx1250_f32_16x16x4_f32`, `..._16x16x32_{f16,bf16}`, `..._16x16x64_{fp8_fp8,fp8_bf8,bf8_fp8,bf8_bf8}`, `wmma_scale_f32_16x16x128_fp8_fp8`, `wmma_scale16_f32_16x16x128_fp8_fp8` | f32, f16, bf16, fp8, bf8 (+ fp8 block-scaled) |
| `gfx11-generic` | same as `gfx1151` | f16, bf16, iu8, iu4 |

- The `gfx1250` catalog entry defines its target family, memory model, limits,
  and nine matrix atoms, including FP8 `SCALE`/`SCALE16` forms. §4C.1 lists the
  omitted block-scaled formats.
- **No integer MFMA atom is declared on any CDNA arch**, even though the silicon
  has shipped `V_MFMA_I32_*_I8` since CDNA1. Integer matrix on CDNA is unwired
  software, not absent hardware.

### 4C. Deltas — silicon capability vs. rocKE's declared atoms

The following gaps compare §4A with §4B. The first five concern atom declarations
only; f64 (4C.6) also lacks an IR type. The gfx942 XF32 declaration gap is now
closed; §4D describes its logical dtype and remaining integration boundaries.

#### 4C.1 gfx1250 — fp4/fp6/bf6 block-scaled atoms are omitted (deliberately)
The part carries `V_WMMA_F32_16X16X128_F8F6F4`, a dedicated
`V_WMMA_F32_32X16X128_F4`, and block-size-16 scaling. The catalog declares only the
**fp8×fp8** `SCALE`/`SCALE16` slice; the entry's own comment records that
"FP4/FP6/BF6 block-scaled forms remain intentionally omitted."

#### 4C.2 gfx1201 — fp8/bf8 WMMA is in silicon but undeclared
RDNA4 provides `V_WMMA_F32_16X16X16_{FP8,BF8}_{FP8,BF8}` and the matching SWMMAC
sparse forms; the catalog declares f16/bf16 only, so fp8 on this arch is
undeclared rather than unavailable.

#### 4C.3 CDNA — integer MFMA is in silicon but undeclared everywhere
`V_MFMA_I32_*_I8` ships on every CDNA generation in §4A, and gfx950 adds the wide
`V_MFMA_I32_16X16X64_I8` / `V_MFMA_I32_32X32X32_I8` forms. rocKE declares none of
them on any CDNA arch. This is why `i8` scores C2=2 and C5=1 (§2.5).

#### 4C.4 RDNA4 / CDNA5 — integer WMMA is in silicon but undeclared
gfx1201 provides `V_WMMA_I32_16X16X16_IU8` and `V_WMMA_I32_16X16X16_IU4` (plus a
K32 `IU4` form and the matching `V_SWMMAC_*` sparse variants); gfx1250 provides
`V_WMMA_I32_16X16X64_IU8` and `V_SWMMAC_I32_16X16X128_IU8`. rocKE declares no
integer atom on either arch. Together with §4C.3, the declaration gaps are
**CDNA integer MFMA and gfx1201/gfx1250 integer WMMA**. `gfx1151` and
`gfx11-generic` do declare both `wmma_i32_16x16x16_iu8` and
`wmma_i32_16x16x16_iu4` (§4B). The existing integer WMMA GEMM builders (§5)
and quant epilogues give `i8` some family coverage; its C5=1 score reflects
limited target and packed-input API coverage, as explained in §2.5.

#### 4C.5 Sparse (SMFMAC / SWMMAC) is entirely undeclared
Structured sparsity is available on gfx942, gfx950, gfx1201 and gfx1250. The
catalog declares no sparse atom on any arch, and no family requests one. No dtype
in §2.4 is blocked on it.

#### 4C.6 f64 matrix is in silicon but undeclared
`V_MFMA_F64_*` is present on gfx90a/gfx942/gfx950. `f64` is not an IR type
at all (§1), so those targets have a vocabulary gap as well as missing atoms.
gfx1250 has no native F64 matrix instruction and is excluded from this gap.

### 4D. XF32 / TF32 across the arch set

| Arch | XF32 matrix instruction |
|---|---|
| gfx90a (CDNA2) | ❌ never present |
| gfx942 (CDNA3) | ✅ `V_MFMA_F32_16X16X8_XF32` (op 62), `V_MFMA_F32_32X32X4_XF32` (op 63) |
| gfx950 (CDNA4) | ❌ absent from the public XML and LLVM target features |
| gfx1151 / gfx1201 (RDNA3.5 / RDNA4) | ❌ never present |
| gfx1250 (CDNA5) | ❌ absent from the public XML and LLVM target features |

**Consequence for rocKE.** The gfx942 catalog declares
`mfma_f32_16x16x8_xf32` and `mfma_f32_32x32x4_xf32`, with logical TF32 A/B and
FP32 C/D. Both Python and C++ lowerers support them and reject these atoms on
other targets. gfx950/gfx1250 have no native XF32 instruction. This atom support
does not add production GEMM/convolution dispatch or cross-target emulation.
See [§1](#1-the-canonical-dtype-set) for the distinction between logical TF32,
raw payload wrapping, explicit RNE preparation, and a BF16 compute mode.

### 4E. The FP8 encoding dialect (FNUZ vs OCP)

Same 8 bits, two incompatible interpretations of the exponent bias:

| Arch | fp8/bf8 dialect |
|---|---|
| gfx942 | **FNUZ** |
| gfx950 | **OCP** |
| gfx1201, gfx1250 | **OCP** |

rocKE carries one `fp8e4m3` / `bf8e5m2` IR type per §1, with the dialect resolved
by target arch at lowering time rather than by the type. **Classic CK** gives each
dialect its own type — `f8_fnuz_t` / `bf8_fnuz_t` at
`include/ck/utility/amd_ck_fp8.hpp:35,48` and `f8_ocp_t` / `bf8_ocp_t` at `:331,377`,
four distinct structs. **CK-Tile** keeps a single `fp8_t` / `bf8_t` pair.
Its `numeric_traits` select `fp8_interpretation` through `CK_TILE_USE_OCP_FP8`
(`include/ck_tile/core/numeric/float8.hpp:214-248`). Internal conversion templates
read that trait (`:269-271,507-509,795-804`); public calls such as
`float_to_fp8(x)` and `fp8_to_float(x)` take no dialect argument (`:979-1004`).
CK-Tile therefore uses build-selected traits, not a required selector at each
public conversion call. rocKE's C6=1 score concerns its own incomplete dialect
validation across families (§2.5).

The failure mode is silence: the same byte pattern decodes to values a power of two
apart with no error raised anywhere. Today the FNUZ/OCP selection is guarded only
in the attention path; nothing generalizes it. gfx950/gfx1250 use OCP, while
the supported gfx942 target uses FNUZ, so callers must account for both dialects.

## 5. Per-family support snapshot

The "Not supported" column records what a family rejects or lacks, not what it is
scheduled to gain.

| Family | Supported | Not supported |
|---|---|---|
| Universal GEMM (`gemm_universal.py`) | f16, bf16 (A/B/C homogeneous, f32 accum) | **fp8/bf8** — `NotImplementedError` at `:659` for any dtype that is not `F16`/`BF16` |
| MFMA GEMM (`mfma_gemm.py`) | f16, bf16 (`_SUPPORTED_DTYPES`, `:178`) | **fp8/bf8** — rejected at `:192-195`; `:62-65` records the missing lane-decode and byte-wise A/B loads, but that docstring is itself stale (it still calls `f16` "the only shipped option" after bf16 landed) |
| Integer WMMA GEMM ([wmma_gemm_iu8.py](../../python/rocke/instances/gfx1151/wmma_gemm_iu8.py)) | Signed int8 A/B packed four values per i32 → i32 accumulation/output; gfx1151 and gfx11-generic (`iu8` WMMA atom) | Raw byte-pointer inputs; targets without this atom; requires complete 16×16 tiles and K a multiple of 16 |
| Integer WMMA GEMM with dequantization ([wmma_gemm_iu8_dequant.py](../../python/rocke/instances/gfx1151/wmma_gemm_iu8_dequant.py)) | Same packed int8 input and i32 accumulation, runtime per-tensor scales → f16 output | Same target and packing constraints; no arbitrary output dtype selector |
| Block-scale GEMM ([block_scale_gemm.py](../../python/rocke/instances/common/block_scale_gemm.py)) | `abquant`, FP8/BF8 A/B → **f32** out on gfx942/gfx950 | `aquant`/`bquant`; `i4_fp8`/`i4_bf8`; non-f32 output; WMMA targets including gfx1250 |
| MatMul-NBits (`_matmul_nbits_common.py`) | A=f16, B=int4, scale f16/f32 (RDNA only) | B widths other than 4-bit; CDNA arches |
| Convolution (`_conv_implicit_gemm_common.py`) | f16, bf16, f32 | **reduced-precision compute over f32 storage** — no selector exists to request it (gpu-ref carries a `USE_TF32` switch; see §1); **fp8/bf8** |
| Attention unified (`attention_unified.py`) | Q/V f16, bf16; f32 accum | fp8/bf8 K/V is **not uniform across instances**; no int8 Q/V |
| Attention FP8 (`fmha_fwd_fp8.py`) | fp8/bf8 K/V decode (gfx950 preferred) | on gfx942 the FNUZ dialect must be selected explicitly (§4E) |
| Grouped convolution (dispatch) | f16, bf16 | fp8/bf8/int8 |
| Quant epilogues (`add_rmsnorm2d_rdquant`) | out i8, fp8e4m3, bf8e5m2 | — |
