# Model contract

## Request

Call the production predictor with an exact target, opcode, wave size, and a
sequence of access records for one instruction in one wave. Each lane may supply
at most one active access, covering the opcode's full width. Submit separate
requests for separate instructions or waves. Each access must be naturally aligned
to the opcode's full width, and its full byte range must fit within the selected
profile's LDS capacity.

Each access has:

- a stable non-negative `access_id`;
- a lane within the selected wave;
- a non-negative `lds_byte_address`;
- a positive `access_width_bytes`;
- an active flag; and
- optional integer coordinates whose axis names are supplied separately by the
  result contract.

Use unique IDs even when multiple accesses share a byte address. Preserve
inactive accesses when the caller needs them displayed; the predictor excludes
them from collision grouping.

## Result

Treat the returned semantic document as authoritative. It contains:

- independent schema and profile versions;
- the exact selected profile identity;
- the normalized request;
- stable access records and classifications;
- conflict and broadcast groups referencing access IDs;
- counts and maximum multiplicity; and
- stable diagnostics.

Conflict multiplicity is the number of accesses in a semantic conflict group. It
is not a performance estimate or a profiler counter prediction.

## Classification

- `normal`: active and not a member of a reported group;
- `conflict`: member of a distinct-address conflict group;
- `broadcast`: member of a supported same-address broadcast group; and
- `inactive`: retained for presentation but excluded from prediction.

Do not collapse broadcasts into conflicts. Do not infer normality from an empty
group list if prediction failed or the request was unsupported.

## Serialization

Use the production canonical JSON functions. They provide deterministic ordering,
JSON primitives only, and strict schema-version validation. Do not serialize
dataclass internals manually or use tuple-keyed JSON objects. Analyze an in-memory
result and its canonical JSON round trip with identical group and classification
semantics.
