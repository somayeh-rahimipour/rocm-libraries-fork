    requirement was stated where it was used. Hoisting made the consumers
    shared, which left the contract stated nowhere -- a new family learns it
    from an ``AttributeError`` at first dispatch.

    A Protocol rather than base-class fields because the fields cannot go on the
    frozen base: every family declares ``arch`` WITHOUT a default, and a
    defaulted inherited field in front of it is a ``TypeError`` at class
    creation ("non-default argument 'arch' follows default argument").
