# Packed FP4 scaled GEMM

The [block-scaled GEMM builder](../../../instances/gfx1250/block_scaled_gemm.py)
accepts `dtype_a="fp4", dtype_b="fp4"` for native gfx1250 SCALE and SCALE16.
`fp4e2m1` is an equivalent spelling for either matrix dtype and for the verifier
`--dtype` option; both spellings select the same packed E2M1 contract.
This path consumes prepacked E2M1 values and E8M0 scale bytes. It does not
quantize floating-point inputs or provide an A16W4 dequantization kernel.

## Input contract

`M`, `N`, and `K` count logical matrix elements. A and B use row-major byte
buffers of shapes `[M, K/2]` and `[N, K/2]`, computing `C = A @ B.T`.
For byte `j`, bits 0–3 encode element `2*j`; bits 4–7 encode element `2*j+1`.
The E2M1 positive codes 0–7 represent `0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6`;
bit 3 is the sign, including negative zero. Every nibble is a valid code.
The pointer ABI is `i8`, with 16-byte-aligned matrix buffers. The builder uses
[`BitPacking`](../../../core/storage.py) for row strides and passes row bases,
dtypes, and alignment to the shared
[`load_matrix_fragment`](../../../helpers/mma_io.py) helper.

| Matrix path | K elements per scale | A/B scale operand |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wmma_scale` | 32 | Four E8M0 bytes packed into i32 |
| `wmma_scale16` | 16 | Eight E8M0 bytes packed into i64 |

Scale memory has shape `[M, K/block_k]` for A and `[K/block_k, N]` for B.
Successive K groups occupy successive bytes, starting at the low byte of the
instruction operand. `scale_dtype="e8m0"` selects this contract; `i8` is its
storage alias. E4M3/E5M3 scale formats are not exposed by this path.
Both modes use the `wmma_scaled` catalog family, selected with matrix dtype
`fp4` or `fp4e2m1`, E8M0 scales for A/B, and K-group size 32 or 16.
The [scaled-WMMA operand descriptor](../../../core/arch/wmma_scale.py) records
the E8M0 scale count and K-group size. The builder packs from that descriptor,
and the lowerers derive the integer carrier width from the same contract.
SCALE with block size 32 is MXFP4. SCALE16 here means FP4 with E8M0 scales
and block size 16.

Each wave computes a 16-by-16 output tile. Lane `l` loads A row and B row
`l % 16` within their tiles. Lane half `h = l // 16` owns logical K ranges
`[32*h, 32*h+32)` and `[64+32*h, 96+32*h)` within each K=128 step. These
are two 16-byte loads, yielding eight i32 words padded with eight zero words
for the builtin's sixteen-word argument. Both scale modes use this input map.
Output slot `i` maps to row `8*h+i`, column `l % 16` within the output tile.

M/N must be multiples of 16 and K a multiple of 128. Mixed operand formats,
partial tiles, scalar FP4 arithmetic, and quantization conversions are outside
this path. The K loop is statically unrolled, as in the existing FP8 builder.

## Verification

The [verifier](block_scaled_gemm_verify.py) builds exact E2M1 code fixtures,
packs them into bytes, and independently decodes the bytes for its reference.
It covers every code point, asymmetric A/B data, independent scales, isolated
K groups, and multiple K steps. FP4 fixtures use finite E8M0 bytes 125–128;
scale extremes and NaN behavior require separate validation.

```sh
python -m rocke.examples.gfx1250.gemm.block_scaled_gemm_verify \
    --dtype fp4 --matrix-path wmma_scale --case all
python -m rocke.examples.gfx1250.gemm.block_scaled_gemm_verify \
    --dtype fp4 --matrix-path wmma_scale16 --m 32 --n 48 --k 256 --compile-route hip
```

COMGR requires a matching LLVM 23 toolchain. With the C++ extension installed,
set `ROCKE_BACKEND=both` to compare Python/C++ LLVM before COMGR compilation.
The HIP verifier invokes the Python HIP lowerer directly. Numerical validation
requires a matching gfx1250 device, NumPy, and ml_dtypes; it does not need torch.
