"""Milestone 0: the external emit RECORDER + `b`-witness gate + addressing round-trip.

Pure CPU (builds IR + inspects it; no compile/run), so it stays in the CPU suite. Target kernel is
the toy LDS-staged GEMM (single wave, single atom, single buffer, identity store/read, Python-unrolled
K-loop -> constant origins) -- the isolation boundary that proves the spine before CRC's symbolic
origins / cooperative scope / swizzle.
