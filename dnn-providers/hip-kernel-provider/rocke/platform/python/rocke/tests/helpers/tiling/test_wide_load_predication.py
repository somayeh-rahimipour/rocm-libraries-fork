"""The wide-GLOBAL-load fully-in-bounds gate (Principle 4). An unmasked wide global load is emitted
ONLY when the tile is provably in bounds on the stride-1 run axis; a ragged/odd tensor (or a runtime
clip that can't be proven aligned) falls to the scalar masked path -- never an out-of-bounds wide
read. LDS is exempt (its allocation is the full tile by construction). Offline, no GPU.
