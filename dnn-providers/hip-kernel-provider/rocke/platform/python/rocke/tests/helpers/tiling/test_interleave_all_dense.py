"""Proof sweep — every dense MMA instruction's interleavability (CPU-only, no GPU).

Approach A: drive the REAL interleaved construction (the library ``InterleavedStyle``) from each dense
traits row and PROVE, for the rows the construction can drive, that

  * the operand K-contiguous <-> free-dim-contiguous transpose is cross-lane-free (``reorder`` tier),
  * the C-shuffle (native accumulator -> store order) is cross-lane-free, and
  * the MMA soundness (positional per-atom K-match) holds,

for a single atom AND a 2x2-atom tile (``free_sub>1`` / multi-patch, e.g. the 32x32 atom's ``P=4``).

Rows that CANNOT interleave are PROVEN to fail the SOT §9 interleavability gate (never skipped
silently) -- only the non-square ``wmma_f32_32x16x128_f4`` does. gfx11 WMMA holds the whole K per lane and
DUPLICATES the operand across the two 16-lane halves; that duplicate is modelled as a replication axis and
proven cross-lane-free (per-lane element-set preservation + a within-one-copy ``reorder``). The exact
population counts are asserted so a catalogue change (a new atom, a changed trait) trips the sweep.

Interleavability depends only on (shape, wave, element size), so bf8/fp8, bf16/f16 and f32/xf32 are
equivalent — but every distinct dense row is still exercised.
