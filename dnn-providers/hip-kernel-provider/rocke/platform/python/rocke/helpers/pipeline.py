    Attributes
    ----------
    num_iters
        Iteration count (Python int).
    double_buffer
        Legacy boolean: ``True`` enables 2-buffer rotation;

    num_buffers
        Number of LDS buffers in the rotation (1 = single buffer,
        2 = classic double buffer / ping-pong, 4 = quad buffer with
        2x prefetch depth — the canonical pattern for keeping more
        VMEM loads outstanding to hide DRAM latency). When >1, each
        iter rotates ``cur = buffers[it % num_buffers]`` and
        prefetches ``buffers[(it + num_buffers - 1) % num_buffers]``.
    wait_vmcnt
        Insert ``s_waitcnt(vmcnt=...)`` before each compute step.
    sync_after_wait
        Insert workgroup barrier after the VMEM wait.
    sync_before_issue
        Insert workgroup barrier before the next ``issue_load`` to close
        the iter-N compute → iter-N+2 issue ABA hazard window.
    overlap_vmcnt
        Use ``s_waitcnt(vmcnt=num_buffers-1)`` (partial drain) instead of
        ``vmcnt(0)`` so prefetched loads stay in flight across compute.
        Pairs with ``sync_lds_only()`` barriers that don't drain VMEM.

        Unlike :meth:`run_ping_pong`, the trip count is not known at build
        time: ``k_extent`` is an i32 SSA ``Value`` holding the reduction
        extent in *elements* (e.g. the ``p_K_gemm`` kernel arg), and
        ``block_k`` is the compile-time tile width.

        Why the body is unrolled 2x
        ---------------------------
        An LDS allocation is a build-time SSA value, so ``buffers[it % 2]``
        cannot be evaluated against a runtime ``it``. Unrolling the body
        twice and stepping by ``2 * block_k`` binds each phase to a
        Python-time buffer constant while still alternating them, which is
        what makes it a real ping-pong rather than a single-buffer loop
        wearing one.

        Odd tile counts
        ---------------
        When the tile count is odd the second phase of the final body
        iteration addresses ``k >= k_extent``. At the real end of the tensor
        those coords fall outside the descriptor's padded bounds, so the
        buffer resource returns zero and a zero tile contributes nothing to
        the accumulator — the same zero-fill the single-buffer path already
        relies on for a partial last tile. Issuing it unconditionally keeps
        the loop free of divergent control flow around barriers.

        That breaks when ``k_extent`` is a split-K slice end inside the
        tensor: the tile at ``k_extent`` is the *next* slice's first tile and
        reads as real data. Pass ``k_zero_fill`` -- an offset whose tile is
        known to read as zero, i.e. the global reduction extent -- and the
        phase-A prefetch is redirected there when it lands at or past
        ``k_extent``. That is one scalar select per iteration, and the barrier
        sequence stays uniform.

        The zero tile keeps a purely data-dependent state (an accumulator)
        unchanged, but not a state that also depends on the offset itself (a
        counter, a running index): Phase B's compute still runs on that
        out-of-range tile. ``mask_tail_state=True`` commits Phase B's state
        only when ``k + block_k < k_extent`` -- one select per state value per
        iteration, after the compute and its barriers, so control flow stays
        uniform. The conv kernels leave it off: their accumulators only ever
        see a zero tile there, and the selects would cost every iteration.

        ``k_lo`` is the first tile offset; it defaults to 0.  Split-K passes
        the slice base here so the loop walks ``[k_lo, k_extent)`` -- the
        reduction is sliced by offsetting both ends, not by rebasing the
        descriptors.

        ``iter_args`` is a sequence of ``(name, init_value)`` pairs, exactly
        as :meth:`~rocke.core.ir.IRBuilder.scf_for_iter` expects.
        ``issue_load_fn(k_offset, buf_pair)`` and
        ``compute_fn(k_offset, buf_pair, state)`` both receive i32 SSA
        values for the tile offset.

        Only the 2-buffer rotation is supported; for single-buffer or
        4-buffer modes use the compile-time variant.
