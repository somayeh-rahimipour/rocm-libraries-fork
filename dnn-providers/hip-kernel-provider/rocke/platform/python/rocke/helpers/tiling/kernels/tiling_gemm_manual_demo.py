"""Lowest-level MANUAL GEMM -- a TEACHING demo showing the PURE CUSTOMIZATION path of the
tiling engine.

This is the FIRST (lowest) layer of the layered authoring API. EVERYTHING is written by hand with
the primitive surface -- nothing is derived for you. Its job is to teach, precisely, how a
register/thread distribution is authored from human geometric quantities, with no MMA calculator
and no conveniences standing between the author and the hardware layout.

Where this sits in the layered API:
  * the DRIVER demo (tiling_gemm_demo) asks `TileMma` to DERIVE the A/B/C operand distributions
    from the atom -- convenient, but the layout is hidden inside the calculator; whereas
  * THIS demo authors the A/B/C distributions MANUALLY via the quantity-major `make_tile_desc`
    surface, so you can see and control exactly which lane + register holds which element. This is
    the escape hatch for a custom / non-standard layout the calculator would not give you.

What is hand-authored here:
  * pointers + `make_tensor_desc` for the memory (lengths + strides, rightmost = stride-1);
  * `TileMma` is configured ONLY to hand back the backend `mma` op + wave_size -- NO layout comes
    from it (`a_desc`/`b_desc`/`c_desc` are authored by us, not by the calculator);
  * the A / B / Acc / C register distributions are authored MANUALLY with `make_tile_desc`;
  * the MMA loop is hand-iterated -- fragments plug straight into the raw `b.mma(op, ...)`.

Layout is RCC (A row-major, B col-major, C col-major). Single 16x16x16 atom, one wave (wave64).

KEY TEACHING POINT -- two INDEPENDENT mappings that this demo keeps deliberately separate:
  * the DESCRIPTOR maps a logical element (e.g. (m, k)) -> a MEMORY ADDRESS, via strides. Pure
    memory layout; it knows nothing about lanes or registers.
  * the DISTRIBUTION maps (lane, register) -> a logical element. Pure hardware placement; it knows
    nothing about memory addresses.
  They never constrain each other -- `load_fragment` simply COMPOSES them (ask the distribution
  "which element?", then ask the descriptor "which address?"). That separation is the whole point
  of the primitive surface, and it is why the same distribution can front any memory layout.

And their AXIS ORDER differs by design: the TENSOR descriptor is authored in PHYSICAL order
(fastest stride right-most, like numpy / CK / CuTe); the TILE descriptor is in LOGICAL matrix
order. A col-major operand bridges the two with a `.permute([...])` VIEW on the tensor descriptor
-- an explicit axis-index reorder (a pure re-labeling of axes -- same bytes); the 2-D swap is
`.permute([1, 0])`.

    # physical memory order; the physical tensor descriptor above is lined up to this logical order

    #   * thread_order     -- lane-carrying axes, FASTEST-moving axis RIGHT-MOST (default = axis order).
