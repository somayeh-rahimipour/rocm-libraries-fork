"""The cooperative global->LDS memory bridge -- the style-agnostic primitives a layout style COMPOSES.

A layout style (``mma/styles/``) owns the *recipe* (which descriptors, in what order); this module
owns the *correctness envelope* the style cannot reach past (rev-7 Principle 8, seam invariants):

- ``cooperative_load_desc`` / ``cooperative_load_width`` -- the block-wide, free-dim-contiguous global
  load tile (the wide, coalesced direction). Rank-2-enforcing.
- ``lds_tile_alloc`` -- the FULL-tile LDS allocation shape, DERIVED from ``desc_extents`` of the
  (K, free) store descriptor (invariant a). The extent is ``bounds``-independent: a style never sizes
  LDS, so it cannot clip-size the allocation (which would let a full-width unmasked read index a
  neighbour workgroup's LDS).
- ``lds_store`` / ``lds_read`` -- the LDS-facing verbs. Their signature has NO ``bounds`` parameter, so
  masking an LDS access is unrepresentable (invariant b -- the cooperative store/read stay full-width
  and unmasked; zeros, if any, flow through LDS and contribute nothing to the MAC). Each runs the
  ``desc_extents``-vs-allocation fit guard UNCONDITIONALLY before emitting (invariant c).
