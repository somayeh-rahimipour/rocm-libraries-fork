"""Coalescing model -- how a wave's per-instruction memory accesses land in cache lines. PURE calc (no
matplotlib): the shared backend for the ``/coalescing`` skill, agents, and the visualization renderer.

GENERIC by construction -- a function of a **distribution** (who touches what), the memory tensor's
**strides** (the real address of each coord, never an assumed row/col-major), the **direction** (load vs store,
which sets the transaction time order), and the **dtype**. It fixes on NO particular descriptor/layout.

It does NOT re-implement vectorization: the b128 cap + the actual vector-run pattern come from
:func:`vector_transactions`. This module adds only the **cross-lane cache-line fusion**: for each wave-wide
memory instruction (one vector per lane), how many distinct cache lines the lanes' addresses touch -> fused
(coalesced) vs scattered. Deterministic from the addresses; the correctness bar is the compiled ASM
(``llvm-objdump`` widths/counts) applied by the ``/coalescing`` skill.
