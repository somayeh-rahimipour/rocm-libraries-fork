"""Phase-C driver for the automated layout-viz pipeline.

Turns a :class:`~rocke.helpers.tiling.tiling_recorder.RecordedPipeline` into verified, renderable
stages. Landing incrementally with the CRC MVP; the first piece is the **symbolic-origin resolver**.

A captured ``window.origin`` entry is an SSA ``Value`` whose ``.op`` back-refs form a walkable DAG that
bottoms out at named ROOTS -- the ``scf.for`` induction variable (the K-loop iteration), ``gpu.thread_id``
(the wave/lane), ``gpu.block_id`` (the macro-tile block), and ``arith.constant`` leaves -- combined by
``arith.add/sub/mul/div/mod``. Resolving an origin = pinning those roots (``k`` / ``tid`` / ``block_id``)
and evaluating the DAG to a concrete int, so a symbolic double-buffered / cooperative origin becomes the
buffer-half + wave offset for a chosen slice.

# The recording is a dataflow graph of TRANSITIONS (transactions + ops) between memory/register states.
# A FLOW is a maximal producer->consumer chain between memory endpoints; every recorded transition
# belongs to EXACTLY ONE flow, so "each transition drawn once" is emergent (not special-cased). Detection
# reuses the block-diagram's own generic segmentation (`extract_blocks` + `_dataflow_edges` +
# `COMBINING_OPS`) -- NOTHING here keys on GEMM nouns (A/B/C are lane TAGS for naming only, from the
# recorded space name). Roles are algorithm-agnostic shapes:
#   - prefetch : a global-load -> LDS-store staging chain whose LDS is later read INTO a combining op.
#   - copy     : a global<->LDS (or LDS->global) staging chain that does NOT feed a combining op.
#   - lds_read : an LDS read that feeds a combining op (the operand readback), its own flow.
#   - load     : a global load that feeds a combining op DIRECTLY (register prefetch, no LDS).
#   - compute  : the combining op(s) + the accumulator fill (rendered as the tee).
#   - epilogue : a combining-op output -> {reorder/cross_lane} -> global store.
# A kernel with no combining op simply yields copy/standalone flows and NO compute (correct).
