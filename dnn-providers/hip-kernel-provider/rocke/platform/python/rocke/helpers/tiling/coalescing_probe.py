"""ASM-backed coalescing orchestrator -- the automation that grounds the pure model on the compiled kernel.

The analysis layer (:mod:`.analysis.coalescing`) is GENERIC and pure: given a distribution + strides +
direction + dtype it reports the b128-IDEAL vectorization + cache-line fusion. This module is the glue that
(a) DERIVES that descriptor from a recorded kernel transaction -- direction, strides, dtype, distribution, and
the arch cache-line size -- so a human never hand-transcribes it (minimizing the error surface), and (b) reads
the ACHIEVED per-lane width straight out of ``llvm-objdump`` and HARD-GATES model-vs-ASM. A gap is fatal, never
a warning: an achieved width below the ideal is exactly the signal that surfaced the C-store b64/b128 defect,
and it means a bug in the model/viz OR in codegen -- the human must look. Reuses :func:`analyze_hsaco`
(``rocke.analysis.isa``) for the disassembly and :func:`assert_asm_backed` for the gate; it invents neither.

Scope note (honest): a GLOBAL STORE is unambiguous in a GEMM (only C stores to global), so the C-store gate is
exact. Distinguishing an A-load from a B-load in the same family from mnemonics alone is NOT possible, so the
load path reports the family's widths and flags the WORST (min) against ideal -- it cannot yet attribute a
width to a specific operand. That limitation is stated, not hidden.
