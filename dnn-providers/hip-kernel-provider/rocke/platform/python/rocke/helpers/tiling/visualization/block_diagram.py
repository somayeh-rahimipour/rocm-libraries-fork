"""Level-0 pipeline BLOCK DIAGRAM -- the map you navigate before drilling into a stage.

Turns a :class:`~rocke.helpers.tiling.tiling_recorder.RecordedPipeline` into a labelled boxes-and-arrows
figure: one block per recorded node -- a mem<->vreg TRANSACTION (global/LDS load/store, the accumulator
fill) or a vreg<->vreg OP (``reorder``/``cross_lane`` transform, the ``mma``). Edges follow the MEMORY
producer -> consumer, NOT mere program order. The K-loop body sits in a loop container (a structured
``scf.for`` emits it once, so ``xN`` is inherent); loop membership is detected from the origin DAG (a node
whose ``window.origin`` references the ``scf.for`` induction variable is inside the loop).

The loop body holds TWO INDEPENDENT flows, decoupled by the double buffer, drawn as parallel lanes:
  * COMPUTE (this tile):   LDS read (cur buf) -> MMA -> accumulator
  * PREFETCH (next tile):  global load (k+1) -> LDS store (other buf)
The prefetch load feeds the STORE, never the read; the read consumes a buffer written a PREVIOUS iteration
(the dashed "swap buffers" edge). Drawing them as one linear chain would imply a dependency that isn't there.

This is the entry point of the selection flow: read the diagram, pick a block, then the coordinator asks
scope (macro/wave) + drivers (wave/buffer/operand) and renders that block's detail via the Phase-C driver.
No layout judgement lives here -- it only reflects the recorded structure.

# are used ONLY when the recording actually contains a COMBINING op -- `_operand` falls back to "C" for
