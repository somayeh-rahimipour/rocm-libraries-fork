"""Shared GEOMETRY helpers for the analysis + visualization layers -- PURE calc, no matplotlib.

The symbolic-origin resolver, the lane-span counter, and the recording's (arch, wave_size) accessor.
Imported by both the gates (``analysis/``) and the renderers (``visualization/``), so it has ONE home
here and neither layer re-rolls it.

A captured ``window.origin`` entry is an SSA ``Value`` whose ``.op`` back-refs form a walkable DAG that
bottoms out at named ROOTS -- the ``scf.for`` induction variable (the K-loop iteration), ``gpu.thread_id``
(the wave/lane), ``gpu.block_id`` (the macro-tile block), and ``arith.constant`` leaves -- combined by
``arith.add/sub/mul/div/mod``. Resolving an origin = pinning those roots (``k`` / ``tid`` / ``block_id``)
and evaluating the DAG to a concrete int.
