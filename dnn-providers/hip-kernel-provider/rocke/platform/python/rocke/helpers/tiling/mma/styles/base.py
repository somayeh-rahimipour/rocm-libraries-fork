"""``LayoutStyle`` -- the operand-layout STRATEGY seam (rev-7 Principle 8).

A layout style is a *profile* (canonical, interleaved, ...) that produces, PER OPERAND, the MMA-ready
register layout (and, for a style that stages through LDS, the memory-bridge descriptors). Canonical and
interleaved are two label-flow choices over ONE machine (``docs/mma_is_machinery.md``), not two machines.

The seam owns the correctness envelope; the style owns only the recipe:

- A style **composes** the style-agnostic toolbox primitives (``cooperative_load_desc``,
  ``TileDesc.swap_dims``/``.reorder_registers``) -- it never owns private copies.
- The accumulator (C) is **always derived** from the atom; a style MUST NOT supply a C descriptor. Its
  only influence on C is the K-distribution its operand layout presents to the atom. ``accumulator_desc``
  is the derived native C for the style's operands (checked against the ``derive_c_distribution`` oracle,
  by an independent path, in :class:`~rocke.helpers.tiling.mma.plan.TileMmaPlan`).
- The MMA-ready descriptor a style produces is validated identically to a derived one -- ``operand_desc``
  feeds ``TileMmaPlan.a_desc``/``b_desc``, which the driver polices with
  ``mma_operand_layout_sound`` + the SOA slice guard. The ``canonical_layouts`` helper remains the
  immutable soundness reference; a style never overrides it.

Adding a style: subclass :class:`LayoutStyle`, implement ``operand_desc`` + ``accumulator_desc`` from the
public primitives, and (if it stages through LDS) expose bridge descriptors the kernel composes with
``cooperative_load_desc`` + the ``memory`` LDS verbs. See ``docs/tiling_api_contract.md``.
