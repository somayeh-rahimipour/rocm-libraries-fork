Per LDS buffer-half, keyed by smem identity + the RESOLVED half: every read address a cooperative

    """Addressing round-trip for one double-buffered LDS space, PER buffer-half.

    Store and read descriptors are both ``_transpose_desc``'d into the same ``(K, free)`` frame, so the
    element ADDRESS and the ``(K, free)`` label coincide -- the gate reduces to: every read address (over
    all waves, at half ``h``) was written by the cooperative store to half ``h``, and the store is a
    bijection with no leak across the half boundary. Origins are resolved via :func:`resolve_origin`;
    the half is keyed on the RESOLVED free-origin, never the raw symbolic ``oth`` expression (the store
    writes ``oth`` while the same-iteration read reads ``cur`` -- pairing those would be a silent bug).

    Rank-2 (free, K): ``free_stride = strides[0]``-locked; invoke once per squeezed batch slice for N-D.
    ``tile_k`` pins the K-loop iteration for the resolver (from the render context). Returns the list of
    verified halves; raises :class:`RoundTripError` naming the first offending read.
