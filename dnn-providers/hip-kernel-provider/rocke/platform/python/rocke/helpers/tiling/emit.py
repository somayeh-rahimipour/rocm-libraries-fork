"""IR-emitting tiling verbs -- the author surface's lowering layer.

This module is EVERYTHING that threads the IRBuilder (``b``) -- the lowering vessel. It drives
ALL addressing from rocke.helpers.tiling's own :class:`~rocke.helpers.tiling.encoding.WarpDistributionEncoding`
via an IR-emitting ``calculate_x`` (:func:`emit_tensor_coordinates`), then reads/writes memory
through the :class:`~rocke.helpers.tiling.descriptors.TensorWindow` (memory side) into a
:class:`~rocke.helpers.tiling.fragments.Fragment` (register side). It bottoms out ONLY at raw IRBuilder
ops (``global_load`` / ``global_store`` / integer arithmetic) -- it does **not** use rocke's
``mfma_gemm_inner`` loaders/k-loop/epilogue. This is the isolated new-API surface.

``b`` is the only rocke dependency here (the IRBuilder + a couple of element types). Everything
about *where each element lives* comes from our encodings; the pure value objects live in
:mod:`rocke.helpers.tiling.descriptors` and :mod:`rocke.helpers.tiling.fragments`.
