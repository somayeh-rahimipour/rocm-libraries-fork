"""Reusable LDS bank-conflict tooling: validated write- AND read-port models + simulators, bit-exact
address map, isolation micro-probes, rocprof harness, and the 3-panel register->LDS
dataflow renderer.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
The /bank-conflict skill repeatedly rebuilt these same pieces as throwaway scripts (one per
investigation), which burned tokens and let the model drift between systems. The MECHANISM (the
CDNA2 LDS write-port rule) and the TOOLING (simulator, probes, validator, renderer) are stable and
arch-parameterized, so they live here once, committed, cross-system consistent. Only the per-CASE
*numbers* (a new kernel/tile/dtype's measured conflicts/access) must be regenerated on the real GPU
each time -- this module stores the METHOD, never a kernel's answer. The `_MECHANISM_*` tables below
are the model's VALIDATION CORPUS (the reference measurements that PROVE the write-port mechanism
reproduces hardware to the integer); they are not a substitute for measuring a new case.

THE CARDINAL RULE: never state a conflict number that is not backed by a model VALIDATED on that
arch, and never state one without its PROVENANCE. Two ways to earn a number, and they are not equal:
  investigate (VALIDATED) -- rocprof hardware counters for THIS case AND this simulator predicting
      those exact counters from the address map. Requires the host GPU to BE that arch. If the sim
      does not reproduce the measurement, the MODEL is wrong -- fix it, do not "meet in the middle".
  simulate   (SIMULATED)  -- no per-case hardware; the gate is `selftest(arch)`, i.e. the arch's
      model reproduces the arch's OWN measured corpus. Cheap, no GPU, and honest ONLY if every number
      and every figure is labelled SIMULATED. An arch with no validated model is a FULL STOP, not a
      guess: `arch_lds` raises and `selftest` refuses to validate one arch with another's corpus.
Never let a SIMULATED number be read as a measured one -- that is what the watermark and the third
verdict state exist to prevent.

NO DANGEROUS DEFAULTS (a hard rule for anyone editing this module)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A parameter that CHANGES A NUMBER (arch, dtype, wave size, strides, origin, swizzle, K-alias depth)
or that is PRINTED ON AN ARTIFACT AS FACT (kernel_label, macro_label, operand_label, dims_label) has
NO default. Every run states it. The reason is specific, not stylistic: a default here does not
error -- it silently analyzes a DIFFERENT kernel than yours and stamps your kernel's name on the
answer, which is exactly the class of confidently-wrong result this module exists to prevent. Wave
size lives on `ArchLDS.WAVE` and element size in `dtype_bytes_of` so they are DERIVED from one home,
never re-defaulted at a call site. Only presentation/verbosity knobs (max_banks, full, verbose,
n_iter, grid_ctas) may default; they cannot change a verdict.

THE MECHANISM (validated bit-exact, gfx90a; SOT: helpers/tiling/docs/lds_banks.md §1.4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CDNA2 LDS *write* datapath is NOT the naive per-address replay counter. The naive rule
`sum_bank (distinct_addresses - 1)` OVER-COUNTS K-aliased stores ~8-9x. The write port has two
hardware constants, both confirmed integer-exact on every measured config AND by independently
reproducing the measured `productive` floor they were NOT fit against:
  1. WRITE-PORT WIDTH = 8 banks/cycle  (`min(banks_used, 8)`): the store port covers an 8-bank
     stripe per cycle, not all 32 banks. (Write-side rule; the read port differs.)
  2. WRITE-COMBINE DEPTH = 4            (`depth / 4`):          same-bank stacked stores drain 4
     per cycle (write-combine of a 4-deep column).

  served_cycles(half-wave, phase) = min(banks_used, PORT_BANKS) * max_bank_depth / COMBINE
  productive (floor)              = ceil(distinct_dwords_in_instruction / NB)   (per instruction)
  SQ_LDS_IDX_ACTIVE   (IDX)       = served
  SQ_LDS_BANK_CONFLICT (BC)       = served - productive
  conflicts/access                = BC / (IDX - BC) = BC / productive

PHASE COMBINE: one instruction's dword-phases PIPELINE through the write port -- a half-wave's
served = MAX over its phases (busiest phase sets the rate). The counter is PER INSTRUCTION; a store
forced to a narrow width issues several instructions, each measured separately with its own
footprint (productive = footprint_instr / NB).

THE PAD-SWEEP STRIPE-ALIGNMENT MODEL (the conflict-FREE fix)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The write-port histogram model reproduces the CONFLICTED configs, but the naive `bank = dword mod
NB` map it is built on CANNOT tell pad8 (HW 1.0) from pad16 (HW 0.0): both give byte-identical
served-group histograms, and the naive verdict is in fact INVERTED vs hardware for padded K-aliased
f16 stores. The physical distinguisher is the K-row's HALF-STRIPE PARITY, not its address:

  Let s = (lds_row_stride_in_dwords) mod NB, and W = dwords/lane (b64->2, b128->4). The half-stripe
  unit is 4*W dwords. The store is CONFLICT-FREE (BC=0) iff the K-row shift is an ODD multiple of
  that unit:            s % (4*W) == 0  AND  (s // (4*W)) is ODD.
  Otherwise it sits at the throughput floor (conflicts/access = 1.0), except the fully-aliased
  s == 0 b64 case which piles the whole 8-wide K column onto one stripe (conflicts/access = 3.0).

`conflict_free_bank_of()` gives the one-lane-per-bank permutation that BC=0 physically means (SOT
lds_banks.md §2) -- what the FIXED-panel bank grid must draw; the naive map must NOT be drawn there.

PUBLIC API & CONTRACTS
----------------------
Preferred entry point is `analyze_store`; the rest are the layers it composes (usable directly for
custom access patterns). Every function that could emit a mislabeled artifact GATES internally.

  analyze_store(descs, *, mode, tile_free, wtag, arch, kernel_label, operand_label, dims_label,
                macro_label, strides, dtype_name, origin, lds_swizzle, measure=None, ...)
      -> ConflictReport. Chains: selftest(arch) -> store_datum -> simulate -> (investigate: measure on
      GPU + HARD gate sim==HW) -> recommend_pad -> (optional verify_fix on GPU) -> render.
      CONTRACT: mode='investigate' REQUIRES `measure` and yields a VALIDATED report; mode='simulate'
      forbids it and yields a SIMULATED report with a watermarked figure. Either way `selftest(arch)`
      must PASS. RAISES ConflictModelError if the probe is not bit-exact, sim != HW, or the model
      fails its own corpus; RAISES ValueError for an arch with no registered model.
  measure callable (INJECTED by the caller): `measure(pad:int, mode='store') -> dict` with keys
      BC, IDX, conflicts_per_access (+ optional ADDR, max_abs_diff). Encapsulates the container
      rocprof run; keeps this module container-agnostic. It is the ONLY host-specific glue.
  ConflictReport: dataclass. `.verdict` (VALIDATED | SIMULATED | MODEL MISMATCH | UNVALIDATED),
      `.conflicts_per_access`, `.fix_pad`, `.located`, `.png`, `.facts_table()` -> the skill's rows.

  selftest(arch) -> bool           GATE: model reproduces THAT arch's measured corpus; refuses an
                                   arch with no corpus. Run before trusting any number.
  simulate(accesses, arch)         write-port model over an address map -> {IDX,BC,productive,c/a}.
  simulate_hist(hists, footprint)  the authoritative per-(half-wave,phase) predictor.
  addr_map(desc, strides)          bit-exact (lane,reg)->element-address map from the REAL emit.
  store_datum(desc, tile_free)     shared (acc, vw, datum{(lane,ph)->(K,free,dword,bank)}) builder.
  collision_lanes(datum)           lanes piling on a bank in a served group (the located conflict).
  predict_pad_sweep / is_conflict_free / recommend_pad / conflict_free_bank_of  the stripe rule.
  gate(sim, measured)              HARD assert sim==HW; RAISES ConflictModelError on mismatch.
  ProbeDescs(.from_coop) / build_probe / run_probe   bit-exact isolation micro-kernels.
  COUNTER_PMC / ROCPROF_RECIPE / parse_counter_csv   the rocprof harness.
  render_conflict_3panel(...)      the figure; GATES sim==measured, fix conflict-free, fixed panel
                                   collision-free before drawing (refuses a mislabeled figure).
  register_arch(arch, hists, pad_sweep[, read_hists, read_provenance])   add an arch + its corpora
      (merges: omitted keys are left untouched, so a read corpus survives a write re-registration).

  READ SIDE (a structurally DIFFERENT port -- see THE READ-PORT RULE below and lds_banks.md §1.5)
  analyze_read(descs, *, tile_free, arch, operand_label, strides, dtype_name, origin, lds_swizzle,
               dwords_per_lane) -> ReadCollisionReport. Prices the read when the arch has a registered
      read model AND the access is in-envelope; otherwise reports GEOMETRY and RAISES on
      `.conflicts_per_access`. `dwords_per_lane` is the ISA width from the DISASSEMBLY -- it is not
      derivable from the address map and is recorded on the report as caller-asserted provenance.
  read_datum(desc, tile_free, arch, strides, dtype_name, *, origin, lds_swizzle)  the read's address
      map, modelling the MERGED instruction (the emit declares vw=1; the backend merges).
  simulate_read_hist(hists, footprint, arch)   the read predictor: max_bank_depth per group, SUMMED.
  register_read_model(arch_name)   register a MEASURED read model; refuses unless selftest passes.
  ReadCollisionReport  `.verdict` (SIMULATED | GEOMETRY ONLY), `.conflicts_per_access` (raises when
      geometry-only), `.detail` (the model's own input histograms), `.facts_table()`.
  READ_MODEL_REGISTRATION_ERROR  None on success; the reason string if gfx90a failed to register at
      import (registration does NOT raise -- an unimportable module is worse than an unpriced read).

EXTENDING TO A NEW ARCH
-----------------------
For the WRITE side call `register_arch(ArchLDS(name, NB, HALF, PORT_BANKS, COMBINE, WAVE), hists,
pad_sweep)`; for the READ side measure that arch's OWN read corpus (`run_probe(mode="read")` + the
n_reads slope) and `register_read_model(name)`, which refuses unless `selftest` passes. Where the
constants come from that arch's ISA + a probe sweep and `hists`/`pad_sweep` are FRESHLY MEASURED on
that arch (same format as gfx90a's `_VALIDATION_CORPUS` entry). Then run `selftest(name)` until it
PASSES. `selftest` REFUSES an arch that has no corpus of its own -- gfx90a's numbers must never be
used to "validate" another arch. Do NOT assume gfx90a constants carry over -- gfx942 / RDNA differ.

    `subject_pad` selects WHICH pad state is the conflicted subject (0 = the raw pad0 pile; a partial
    pad shows its residual piles). The representative bank + multiplicity are DERIVED from the data,

      'simulated' (simulate mode)    -- no per-case hardware exists, so the gate is instead that

# ==================================================================================================
# READ-side analysis
# ==================================================================================================
# WHY THIS IS NOT `analyze_store` WITH A DIFFERENT DESCRIPTOR
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# `PORT_BANKS` and `COMBINE` are WRITE-port constants and every `hists`/`pad_sweep` row is a
# store-mirror measurement. Running `simulate()` over a read's address map would apply write constants
# to a read and emit a confidently wrong conflicts/access -- the exact class of result this module
# exists to prevent. The read port obeys its own rule, measured separately (below).
#
# Two tiers of answer, and the report always says which one you are holding:
#   COST     -- the arch has a registered read model whose `selftest` passes AND the access is inside
#               that model's validated envelope. `conflicts_per_access` is available.
#   GEOMETRY -- otherwise. "Which lanes of a served group address DIFFERENT dwords in the SAME bank"
#               is a property of the address map alone and is always sound; turning that N-way into a
#               replay count is NOT, so `conflicts_per_access` RAISES rather than guessing.
#
# TO SUPPORT A NEW ARCH: measure its own read corpus (`run_probe(descs, mode="read", ...)` + the
# n_reads slope), derive that port's rule, and `register_read_model` it -- which refuses unless
# `selftest` passes. Never carry one target's read constants to another.
# ==================================================================================================
# THE READ-PORT RULE (gfx90a, VALIDATED -- structurally different from the write port)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#     served_read(half_wave, phase) = max_bank_depth(half_wave, phase)    # NO port cap, NO combine
#     IDX_read   = SUM over half_waves SUM over phases  served_read       # read phases SERIALIZE
#     productive = ceil(distinct_dwords_in_instruction / NB)              # same as writes
#     BC         = IDX - productive        =>  conflicts/access = max_depth - 1
#
# ZERO free constants: a general min(banks,P)*depth/min(banks,C) must satisfy min(b,P)==min(b,C) at
# b = 4,8,16,32, so the terms cancel identically -- PORT_BANKS/COMBINE are NOT features of the read
# path. The two ports differ in BOTH the per-group cost function AND the phase rule: writes cap at an
# 8-bank stripe and PIPELINE their phases (MAX); reads serve all banks in parallel and SERIALIZE
# theirs (SUM). At depth 2 the two rules are numerically identical, which is why a single histogram
# point could not separate them -- the m_sub=16 (depth 8) row is what decided it.
#
# `max_depth` is MEASURED to be the sole cost determinant, not assumed: across gfx90a pads 0/2/4/6 the
# banks_used sweeps 16 -> 20 -> 24 -> 28 and the depth distribution goes {2:16} -> {1:24, 2:4} (mean
# depth 2.00 -> 1.14) while the measured cost stays CONSTANT. That refutes every rule reading
# banks_used or the depth distribution -- accesses-per-bank, mean depth, and bandwidth terms alike.
#
# ENVELOPE (gated, not assumed): 2 dwords/lane (ds_read2_b32) and no broadcast. Outside it the model
# is not validated and `analyze_read` falls back to geometry only. Group size: 8 and 16 are RULED OUT
# by the ladder; 32 vs 64 are not separable by this descriptor family -- CDNA half-wave 32 retained.

# Per-arch model validation corpus + self-test
# (proves the mechanism reproduces THAT arch's hardware; NOT per-case answers)
# ==================================================================================================
# The corpus is keyed PER ARCH. Each arch's model is validated ONLY against measurements taken on
# that arch -- gfx90a's numbers must never be used to "validate" gfx942 (different NB / port / combine).
# To add a new arch: (1) add its ArchLDS to ARCHS, (2) measure its own `hists` + `pad_sweep` on the
# real GPU and add a `_VALIDATION_CORPUS[<name>]` entry, (3) run `selftest(<name>)` until it PASSES.
# Until an arch has its own corpus, `selftest` REFUSES it (no silent cross-arch validation).
#
# A bank conflict is a property of the PHYSICAL store geometry ONLY -- the store WIDTH, the LDS row
# stride, the K-alias depth -- NEVER of which operand (A/B) or tensor it came from. So the corpus is keyed
# by PHYSICAL descriptors, context-agnostic: two stores with the same (wtag, tile_free) but a different
# K-alias depth are DIFFERENT rows (e.g. a b128 store into a 256-wide tile is depth-8 for one coop layout,
# depth-16 for another) -- the depth is what the model reads, not the operand.
#
# hists   : per-INSTRUCTION measured histograms. Each store is K-aliased so every used bank has the same
#           depth. (name, banks_used, depth, n_phases, footprint_dwords, HW_IDX, HW_BC). `name` is a
#           physical descriptor (wtag / footprint / banks), not a tensor.
# pad_sweep: measured store-mirror pad sweep. (wtag, tile_free, pad, HW conflicts/access, pad0_depth);
#           row stride in dwords = (tile_free + pad) / 2. `pad0_depth` = the pad0 K-alias depth of THAT
#           geometry (read off its address map), which sets the stripe unit NB*W/depth. The legacy depth-8
#           rows keep pad0_depth=8 (== the old 4*W default); a wider/deeper alias needs a nearer pad (the
#           b128 depth-16 store into a 256-wide tile is conflict-free at +16, not +32).
