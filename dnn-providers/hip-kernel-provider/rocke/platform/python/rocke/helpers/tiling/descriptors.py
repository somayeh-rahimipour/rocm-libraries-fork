"""The memory-layout value objects: an unpositioned :class:`TensorDesc` and the positioned
:class:`TensorWindow` cut from it.

Every mature library carries a lengths+strides+dtype descriptor SEPARATELY from the thread
mapping, then composes them: cuBLASLt `cublasLtMatrixLayout_t`, cuTENSOR
`cutensorTensorDescriptor`, CUTLASS/CuTe `Layout=Shape:Stride`, CK `TensorDescriptor` +
`tile_distribution`. Unlike the C-API handles, ours is a TRANSPARENT value object -- the point
of this layer is that you can read it.

This module is the MEMORY side of the surface -- it is pure data (no IRBuilder, no dtype
casting). It says WHERE a tensor sits and WHICH sub-box a tile covers; the IR verbs in
:mod:`rocke.helpers.tiling.emit` turn a window into actual loads/stores.

- :class:`TensorDesc` -- the pure, ptr-free memory layout (lengths + strides + dtype), with an
  OPTIONAL author-declared per-axis `axis_roles` (batch / free / contraction) so an N-D tensor
  carries the semantics a positional shape cannot (which axis is the contraction K).
- :class:`TensorWindow` -- a `TensorDesc` positioned at an `origin` (+ optional per-axis clip
  `bounds`): the 'where' handed to load/store.

N-D -> rank-2 reduction. An MMA consumes a rank-2 `(free, K)` operand, but authors bring rank-N
tensors (a batched GEMM is `(batch, M, K)`). `TensorWindow.at_index(axis, i)` pins a BATCH axis to
one index and `TensorDesc.squeeze(axis)` drops a length-1 BATCH axis -- both TYPED against the
declared roles: they refuse to reduce the free or contraction axis (that would silently drop matmul
terms), and refuse to operate at all without declared roles (never a bare `rank==2` check).
`TensorDesc.assert_mma_operand()` is the boundary gate: rank-2 with exactly one free + one
contraction axis, in EITHER order (A is (M, K) = (free, contraction); B is (K, N) = (contraction,
free), its atom orientation) -- the roles are labels, the order matches the operand's tile descriptor.

    In a window the `lengths` are the valid extent (the default clip bound) and `strides` are the
