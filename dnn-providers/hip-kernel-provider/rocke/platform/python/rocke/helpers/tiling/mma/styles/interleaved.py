"""``InterleavedStyle`` -- the free-contiguous layout style: wide coalesced global loads land free-dim
fastest, then a single in-register reorder makes them MMA-ready.

Chosen when both operands are FREE-DIM contiguous in global memory (A's M, B's N are the stride-1 axis):
a K-contiguous/canonical load would be VW=1, while this style loads the whole free run wide and the
global->LDS store is an IDENTITY reposition (the free dim is already innermost). It PRODUCES an
N-lane-major accumulator against an N-stride-1 C (the coalesced C store is produced, never recovered).

Composes the style-agnostic primitives -- ``TileDesc.reorder_registers`` for the register significance,
``cooperative_load_desc`` (in ``rocke.helpers.tiling.memory``) for the global load, ``TileDesc.swap_dims``
for the (free,K)<->(K,free) reposition -- so the interleaved recipe is a composition, not a private copy.
The accumulator is DERIVED (:meth:`accumulator_desc`): interleaved's MMA-ready operand is a register
REORDER presenting the SAME K-distribution to the atom, so the atom produces the same native C.

        ``free_lanes`` is PER OPERAND (``traits.m`` for A -- free axis M; ``traits.n`` for B -- free axis

        (d, ka, j) -- free-atom major, K-atom, K-within -- the MMA-ready (SOA) order the driver slices.
        The delta is the mandatory in-register reorder, the price of the wide LDS read.
