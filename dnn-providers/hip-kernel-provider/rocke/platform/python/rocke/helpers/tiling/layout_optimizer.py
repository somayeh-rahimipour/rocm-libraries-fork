"""Layout optimizer -- ``evaluate_transform`` / ``optimize_layout`` as a min-cost transform search.

The transform between two register STATES is never a formula to look up; it is the delta between two
constructed layouts, discovered by rocKE's own solver (:func:`classify_transform`) and priced by a cost
ladder. :func:`evaluate_transform` answers "is there a valid path from a source layout to a target, and what
does it cost". :func:`optimize_layout` is the minimization: given a source and candidate target distributions
(supply your own, or sweep them with :func:`enumerate_stripings`), return the CHEAPEST valid one -- trying a
free symmetry / an intra-lane reorder / a different striping / an LDS reposition before ever falling to
cross-lane (the last resort, whose cost grows with tile size).

Cost ladder (cheapest -> last resort):
  0    relabel / symmetry        register-identity axis rename (A<->B M<->N, col<->row) -- zero movement
  1    reorder, dword-aligned    whole-VGPR register MOVs
  ~pk  reorder, sub-dword        unpack/move/repack, cost ~ dtype pack factor (f16 2x, f8 4x)
  rt   reposition via LDS        the cheaper alternative to a register CROSS-LANE when the data already transits
                                 LDS -- a re-ownership via LDS re-addressing. NOT free, and NOT below a register
                                 reorder: it is a full round-trip = store + read at the throughput FLOOR + a
                                 BARRIER (paid even conflict-free) + the NEW access's bank conflicts (TWO
                                 patterns, store AND read, each EMPIRICAL under its own port rule via
                                 `/bank-conflict`) + any LDS capacity/occupancy cost. Routing through LDS can
                                 INTRODUCE conflicts absent from the register path -> measure the new pattern per
                                 case. The floor **scales with the #registers moved** (LDS is BANDWIDTH-bound).
                                 Pass ``lds_conflict_cost=(store_bc, read_bc)``; without it the edge is a flagged
                                 LOWER BOUND (barrier + bandwidth only).
  hi   cross_lane                DPP / ds_bpermute -- LAST RESORT, cost scales with **(ops-per-register) x
                                 #registers**: a 1-op/reg permute is cheap, grouped / multi-op permutes do
                                 MORE ops/reg -> dearer. Worse as the tile grows.

**Equal shots at the empirical frontier.** ``cross_lane`` and ``reposition_lds`` are flagged ``empirical`` --
their heuristic costs are estimates, NOT trustworthy enough to eliminate one another. So when the cheapest
valid path comes down to LDS-vs-cross-lane, :func:`recommend` returns BOTH as co-contenders to settle by
TESTING (`/bank-conflict` + a wall-time sweep) -- neither falls out on these numbers alone. Deterministic
edges (relabel / reorder / identity) that beat both are trustworthy winners and DO decide outright.

Validity is rocKE's own gates: :func:`mma_operand_layout_sound` (per-operand sound MMA operand), optionally
the pairwise :func:`mma_pair_k_aligned` (``A.K-dist == B.K-dist`` -- pass ``k_partner``), and the tier from
:func:`classify_transform`. No reference tables, no hand formulas -- read off the actual layouts, so it is
correct for any context (atom / wave / #atoms / tile shape / dtype).
