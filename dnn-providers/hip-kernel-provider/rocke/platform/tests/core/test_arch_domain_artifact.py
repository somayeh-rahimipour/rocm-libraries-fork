"""Gate the generated intrinsic arch-domain artifacts against drift.

``tools/gen_arch_domain.py`` measures, per LLVM flavor, which intrinsic
declarations actually link for which gfx target, and commits the answer as
``python/rocke/core/arch/data/intrinsic_arch_domain.<flavor>.json``. A generated
artifact that is not gated drifts from its generator, and a stale availability
table is worse than none because it is trusted.

Two gates, because they fail for different reasons and are available in
different places:

* **Structure** runs everywhere — no LLVM, no GPU, no built C++ engine. It reads
  the committed JSON and checks it against the decl table it claims to describe.
  This is the gate that catches the realistic drift: someone adds, renames or
  removes an intrinsic key and the artifact silently stops covering it. The
  artifact would still be internally consistent, still parse, and still look
  authoritative, while saying nothing about the new key.

* **Regeneration** re-probes the toolchain and asserts the committed column for
  *this host's* flavor comes back byte-identical. It is the only check that can
  catch a wrong measurement rather than a missing one. A full sweep is ~150 keys
  x 7 targets and finishes in seconds, so it is a test rather than a nightly.

A host can only ever measure its own LLVM, so a flavor with no matching
toolchain is skipped, never failed — "we did not get an answer" must not be
recorded as "the answer is no". Same reason the artifact distinguishes
``arch_absent`` (the target genuinely cannot lower it) from ``target_unsupported``,
``toolchain_crash`` and ``toolchain_timeout`` (no data).

This file is a **source-tree** gate and is excluded from the installed test
tree by `CMakeLists.txt`. It has to be: it imports the generator out of
`tools/`, which is not installed, and an uninstallable import in an installed
test is not one skipped test but a collection error that takes the whole
pytest session down with it. The exclusion is the contract; keep the two in
step if this file is ever renamed.
