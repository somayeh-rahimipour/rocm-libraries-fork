"""Generate the intrinsic availability table (the "arch domain") by probing the
installed toolchain.

# Why this exists

rocke resolves an intrinsic `declare` on ONE axis: the LLVM flavor. The target
arch is consumed only to pick an ISA backend (`lower_llvm.py`, `backend_for(arch
or "gfx950")`) and never reaches the decl table -- so "is this intrinsic
available on this GPU" is checked nowhere at build time. See
`dsl_docs/development/arch_axis_proposal.md`.

This tool measures the missing axis instead of hand-maintaining it, and commits
the result as a data file. Nothing consumes the artifact yet; landing the data
first is deliberate (it cannot break anything, and it surfaces the defects that
justify the rest).

# Two stages, because the two axes are answered by different tools

Stage A -- the flavor axis -- asks whether this LLVM knows the name at all. It
is arch-free, so it runs once per key rather than once per (key, arch), and it
uses `opt -S`: LLVM resolves a recognised `llvm.*` declare on parse, attaching
the intrinsic's attributes and remangling overloads, while an unrecognised name
round-trips verbatim as an ordinary external function. See `_name_exists`.

Stage B -- the arch axis -- compiles AND LINKS a probe module per (key, arch),
for names that survived stage A. It is a link for the same reason
`check_ir_validity.py` is: a `declare` for a nonexistent intrinsic is accepted
by `opt -passes=verify` AND by `clang -S` -- to the backend it is an ordinary
external call, emitted as a GOT-relative `s_swappc_b64` -- and only the link
forces the symbol to resolve. It runs in a subprocess because an intrinsic that
exists but is unsupported on the target reaches `report_fatal_error`, which
kills the process.

The split is what makes this cheap: we do not need a hand-written compatibility
matrix, we can read each answer off its own oracle.

    stage A resolves      -> continue to stage B
    stage A verbatim      -> "name_absent"   this SPELLING is not an intrinsic
                                             in this LLVM (flavor axis)
    link OK               -> "ok"            available here
    Cannot select / fatal -> "arch_absent"   the name is real, this target
                                             cannot lower it (arch axis)

Three more buckets exist so that a non-answer is never recorded as a negative:

    invalid target ID     -> "target_unsupported"  this clang cannot target this
                                                   arch at all; it has no opinion
    clang crashed         -> "toolchain_crash"     asking the question killed the
                                                   compiler; we did not get an
                                                   answer, only a bug report
    anything else         -> "probe_error"         OUR module was malformed

`name_absent` deserves care when reading results: it means the exact mangled
string rocke emits is not a known intrinsic. A genuinely nonexistent operation
and a merely mis-mangled overload suffix are indistinguishable here -- both are
bugs in the decl table, but they are different bugs.

# Provenance is not optional

A result is only meaningful against the toolchain that produced it, and a host
can only ever validate its own flavor. The artifact therefore records the clang
identity and the flavor rocke resolved, and the generator refuses to run when
those two disagree -- an artifact labelled with the wrong LLVM vintage is worse
than no artifact, because it looks authoritative.

Usage:
  python rocke/platform/tools/gen_arch_domain.py            # write the artifact
  python rocke/platform/tools/gen_arch_domain.py --check    # CI: regen is a no-op
  python rocke/platform/tools/gen_arch_domain.py --only mfma --verbose

    """Build a minimal module that declares an intrinsic and calls it.

    Returns (module_text, ""), or ("", reason) when the declare cannot be
    parsed -- an unparseable row is a probe_error, never a negative result.

    Every non-constant operand is a real SSA value, not `poison`. `poison` is a
    valid constant of every first-class type and so looks like the obvious
    generic choice, but it makes the probe lie: a poison `i32` operand sends
    `raw.ptr.buffer.load.lds` into "Do not know how to expand this operator's
    operand!" on gfx942, where the same call with concrete integers lowers
    cleanly -- a false arch_absent. Integers, floats, vectors and aggregates
    therefore arrive as kernel arguments, and non-generic pointers as an
    addrspacecast of one.

    `literal_ints`, when set, replaces every integer kernel argument with that
    literal value. Some operands must be immediates even though the declare
    does not mark them `immarg`: rocke's decl table is hand-written and records
    `immarg` only where an author happened to add it, while LLVM checks the
    real intrinsic signature. `raw.ptr.buffer.load.lds`'s size operand is the
    example, and the two vintages report the mismatch differently -- llvm20
    fails to legalise (on *every* arch, reading as a universal arch_absent when
    the truth is "CDNA yes, RDNA no"), llvm22 rejects it up front with "immarg
    operand has non-immediate parameter". This variant exists to rescue both,
    and only those two diagnostics.

    `imm_int`, when set, is the value given to every `immarg` operand in place
    of the default 0. A parameter that is already marked `immarg` is never
    touched by `literal_ints` -- it is a constant either way, so the rescue
    above has nothing to substitute -- but the *value* can still be illegal,
    and an illegal immediate is indistinguishable from an unsupported target
    from the diagnostic alone: both say `Cannot select`. `global.load.lds`
    takes a per-lane transfer size whose legal values are 1, 2 and 4, so 0
    recorded every CDNA target as incapable of an instruction they run in
    production. The only way to tell the two apart is to ask again with a
    different value.

    All `immarg` operands move together, as `literal_ints` does. A declare
    whose immediates have disjoint legal domains would need a cross product,
    and nothing in this table does; if one appears, it reads as `arch_absent`
    (conservative, and the direction that gets noticed) rather than as a wrong
    `ok`.

    The result is stored `volatile` so the call survives -O3; without it, DCE
    would drop the reference and the link would succeed spuriously.
