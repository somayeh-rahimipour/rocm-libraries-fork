#   Wire the compile -> prune -> pack DAG for ONE authored source root.
#
#   The root is walked recursively. Each descriptor's authored
#   subpath is preserved into the packed tree. Producer selection is per-UKD on
#   kernel_source.kind, never per-folder, so one root feeds all producers into
#   ONE kpack per arch.
#
#   OUT_ROOT is where the packer writes: one output folder, wiped and filled by
#   this invocation alone. No two invocations may share a destination. One
#   source root may be invoked more than once, into different output roots.
#   Installation is not wired here -- a root delivers into arch_content/ or
#   test_arch_content/ in the build tree, and those two trees are installed
#   wholesale by hip-kernel-provider/CMakeLists.txt.
#
#   A source root that is not a directory, or a missing output root, is a
#   configure error: each one makes the pack step write nothing, and a consumer
#   cannot tell that apart from a broken layout.
#
#   What actually differs between roots is declared, not forked into a second
#   function:
#
#   Every root runs under ROCKE_INTERP, the wheel-provisioned interpreter, so
#   `import rocke`/`kernels` resolve wherever a UKD names them. Producer
#   selection stays per-UKD on kernel_source.kind, so a root holding no rocKE
#   descriptor never invokes that producer and pays only the interpreter.
#
#   ROCKE_READY is the venv's wheel-install stamp, and is what the pack step
#   depends on rather than the interpreter itself: the interpreter's own rule
#   carries no content dependency, so an edge to it would not restage when a
#   kernel under rocke/library changes. ROCKE_WHEEL_STAMP is the wheel content
#   digest, recorded into each rocKE UKD's provenance so a shipped kernel names
#   the wheel that produced it. ROCKE_COMGR_LIB, if set, is forwarded to the
#   tool environment.
#
#   PACK_JOBS caps the worker processes one pack may spawn. Omitted, the packer
#   sizes itself against the machine, which fits a root large enough to repay the
#   startup cost. Every root here is a separate custom target with no ordering
#   edge between them, so the generator runs them at once and unbounded pools
#   multiply. 1 selects the packer's serial path.
#
#   NAME is also the source label the packer writes into every descriptor's
#   provenance. The function records NAME and the absolute SOURCE_ROOT in a
#   global registry, which hkp_verify_embedded_sources() reads to resolve a
#   descriptor's authored location.

#   Add a build step that checks <t> against the staged descriptors it serves.
#
#   Every value of STAGED_DESCRIPTOR_ROOTS is a packer output tree. None of them
#   is an authored source tree.
#
#   Every embedded_source descriptor under STAGED_DESCRIPTOR_ROOTS names a kernel
#   source. The step reads the key table embed_kernel_sources() wrote for <t>
#   and fails the build when a named source is absent from it, or when the file
#   registered under a key is not the file at the authored location the
#   descriptor's provenance records.
#
#   A descriptor resolves its own source root from its provenance.source_label,
#   through the registry hkp_wire_pack_target() fills. The step joins that root
#   with the descriptor's rel_dir and source_file, and compares the whole path
#   against the registered one. Every wired label goes to every call site, so a
#   descriptor written by a pack no PACK_NAMES value lists still resolves.
#
#   PACK_NAMES lists the pack roots that write STAGED_DESCRIPTOR_ROOTS. Each one
#   contributes its stamp file twice: as a dependency, so packing a root reruns
#   the check, and as an argument, so the step also fails when a stamped pack
#   root holds no descriptor at all. A name whose root is not wired contributes
#   neither, so a dormant root -- production, with no source root set -- is not
#   held to that rule.
#
#   An absent root, an empty root, a root with no embedded_source descriptor and
#   an empty key table each pass. A root emptied after its pack stamped it does not.
#
#   The comparison runs one way, from a staged descriptor to the table. A key no
#   descriptor names is not an error, and neither is a descriptor no pack stages.
#   The tool's docstring records why neither reverse direction can be turned on
#   while the descriptor and the embedding declaration are written independently.

# hkp_rocke_wheel_python_interp(<out_interp> <out_ready> <wheel_stamp>)
#   Provision a build-local interpreter carrying the rocke + rocke_library
#   wheels. With ROCKE_BUILD_PYENV ON they are built by the rocke-wheels target,
#   which rides HIPKERNELPROVIDER_ENABLE_ROCKE; with it OFF there is no such
#   target and the wheels are supplied through ROCKE_WHEEL_DIR. Every pack step
#   imports rocke/kernels from these wheels rather than from the editable dev
#   venv, in either provenance.
#
#   Not ROCKE_PYENV_PYTHON: production ships wheels, so the packs must test wheels.
#
#   TWO rules, with deliberately different dependency sets:
#
#     Rule A produces the interpreter. Expensive -- it reaches the index for
#     msgpack/zstandard -- and carries NO content dependency, so it runs once per
#     build tree and never again.
#     Rule B produces <out_ready>, reinstalling the wheels into that venv. Cheap
#     and offline, and the only rule keyed on wheel content.
#
#   Merged, as they once were, one edited rocKE kernel tore the whole venv down
#   and re-provisioned it over the network. Pack steps therefore depend on
#   <out_ready>, never on <out_interp>.
#
#   The venv is HERMETIC:
#     - no --system-site-packages: the dev venv inherits it to pick up the
#       system ROCm torch, but torch is not a build dependency. Inheriting the
#       system environment is how a build silently starts depending on whatever
#       happens to be installed on the machine.
#     - no `pip install --upgrade pip`: unconditional network access on every
#       provisioning run, to install two local files.
#     - --no-index: hermeticity enforced by the build rather than assumed.
#     - --no-deps: rocke declares numpy>=1.24 and rocke-library declares rocke.
#       Verified that the whole build path -- import rocke, import kernels,
#       build_attention_dense, and the comgr entry rocke.helpers.compile_kernel
#       -- works with neither installed; numpy is imported only by examples/,
#       heuristics/, benchmark/ and runtime/, which lowering never touches. The
#       dependency goes deliberately unsatisfied: nothing vendored, nothing
#       fetched. Should a future kernel import numpy at build time, the failure
#       is a loud ImportError naming the module rather than a silent pull from
#       an index.
#     - --force-reinstall: pip treats a same-name/same-version wheel as already
#       satisfied and leaves the OLD bytes in place. Since the version never
#       bumps, this flag is what makes a changed wheel actually land.
#
#   Rule B depends on the wheel digest stamp, not the wheels, so a byte-identical
#   rebuild does not reinstall.
#
#   The rocke import check runs in RULE B, as its last step, rather than at
#   configure time: the venv and the wheels are both add_custom_command outputs
#   that do not exist until the build runs, so there is nothing to probe at
#   configure time. Running it there also means it validates exactly the wheels
#   just installed, in the interpreter the pack step will use.
