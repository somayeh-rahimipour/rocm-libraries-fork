#   Normalize GPU_TARGETS (or AMDGPU_TARGETS) into a bare gfx arch list,
#   stripping feature suffixes (gfx942:xnack-) and dropping anything that is not
#   a concrete gfx target name.
#
#   A concrete name is a lowercase processor id (gfx942) optionally followed by
#   lowercase hyphen-separated words that name a distinct target (gfx1250-strict).
#   Dropped:
#     - TheRock family names, recognised by any hyphen-separated word of
#       dcgpu, dgpu, igpu or all, so a variant such as gfx950-dcgpu-asan is
#       dropped with its family (gfx94X-dcgpu, gfx950-dcgpu, gfx906-dgpu,
#       gfx90c-igpu, gfx950-all);
#     - generic targets (gfx11-generic), which no device reports;
#     - anything else not of that shape (native, GFX942, gfx).
#   Only the shape is checked: an unrecognised lowercase suffix (gfx1250-typo) is
#   kept and fails in the compiler rather than here.
#
#   <out_source_var> receives the name of the variable the
#   targets came from, or empty when neither is set, so a caller can name it in a
#   diagnostic. No intersection with a fixed fixture set: the tool compiles from
#   authored sources for whatever arch is requested.
#
#   The only consumer of GPU_TARGETS in dnn-providers/. The sibling kpack
#   producer, src/engines/asm_sdpa_engine/CMakeLists.txt, declares an explicit
#   list instead because it globs prebuilt .co files; this step compiles from
#   source and can target any real gfx, so it reads GPU_TARGETS.
#
#   Elsewhere in this repo a gfxNNX-style label is a selector matched against a
#   concrete arch (shared/ctest/parse_test_categories.py,
#   test/therock/test_runner.py); here the value reaches hipcc's --offload-arch,
#   where a family name is unusable rather than coarse. Hence drop-with-warning,
#   not passthrough, and no family-to-arch expansion table.

#   Wire the compile -> prune -> pack DAG for ONE authored source root.
#
#   The root is walked recursively. Each descriptor's authored
#   subpath is preserved into the packed tree. Producer selection is per-UKD on
#   kernel_source.kind, never per-folder, so one root feeds all producers into
#   ONE kpack per arch.
#
#   OUT_ROOT is where the packer writes: one output folder, wiped and filled by
#   this invocation alone. No two invocations may share a destination. One
#   source root may be invoked more than once, into different output roots.
#   Installation is not wired here -- a root delivers into arch_content/ or
#   test_arch_content/ in the build tree, and those two trees are installed
#   wholesale by hip-kernel-provider/CMakeLists.txt.
#
#   A source root that is not a directory, or a missing output root, is a
#   configure error: each one makes the pack step write nothing, and a consumer
#   cannot tell that apart from a broken layout.
#
#   What actually differs between roots is declared, not forked into a second
#   function:
#
#   ENABLE_ROCKE says whether the rocKE producer may run, and is required so no
#   caller can reach either mode by omission. It mirrors
#   HIPKERNELPROVIDER_ENABLE_ROCKE: the rocKE engine and its wheels exist only
#   when that option is ON, so a root cannot enable a producer the build never made.
#
#   ON: ROCKE_INTERP, ROCKE_READY, ROCKE_PYTHON_DIR and ROCKE_WHEEL_STAMP are
#   required. Every root runs under ROCKE_INTERP with ROCKE_PYTHON_DIR prepended
#   to PYTHONPATH, so `import rocke`/`kernels` resolve from the private wheels
#   wherever a UKD names them. Producer selection stays per-UKD on
#   kernel_source.kind, including roots holding only hip descriptors.
#   ROCKE_READY is the private directory's wheel-install stamp. The pack step
#   depends on it rather than only the interpreter, so changing a kernel under
#   rocke/library restages the pack. ROCKE_WHEEL_STAMP is the wheel content
#   digest, recorded into each rocKE UKD's provenance so a shipped kernel names
#   the wheel that produced it. ROCKE_COMGR_LIB, if set, is forwarded to the
#   tool environment.
#
#   OFF: every ROCKE_* keyword is a configure error, since each would name a
#   toolchain the build does not have. The root runs under the base
#   Python3_EXECUTABLE (hip compiles shell out to hipcc and are
#   interpreter-agnostic) with no rocKE environment, no PYTHONPATH prepend and
#   no wheel edge, and the tool gets --disable-kind for each kind
#   _hkp_disabled_kinds() lists (rocke): a rocKE UKD prunes as an arch-pruned one
#   does, and a KDP left with no UKD does not ship.
#
#   EXCLUDE_FOLDERS names top-level child folders of the root the pack does not
#   read at all: the families of HKP_DESCRIPTOR_FAMILIES whose option is OFF.
#
#   PACK_JOBS caps the worker processes one pack may spawn; 1 selects the packer's
#   serial path. Omitted, the packer sizes its pool against the machine. Roots have
#   no ordering edge between them, so the generator runs them at once: the test
#   roots name a small cap so their pools do not multiply, and the product root
#   omits it because it is the root expected to be large enough to repay a full pool.
#
#   NAME is the source label written into every descriptor's provenance. NAME, the
#   absolute SOURCE_ROOT, OUT_ROOT and ARCHES go into a global registry read by
#   hkp_verify_embedded_sources() and hkp_register_census_tests().

#                             PACK_NAMES <names>)
#   Add a build step that checks <t> against the staged descriptors it serves.
#
#   Every value of STAGED_DESCRIPTOR_ROOTS is a packer output tree. None of them
#   is an authored source tree.
#
#   Every embedded_source descriptor under STAGED_DESCRIPTOR_ROOTS names a kernel
#   source. The step reads the key table embed_kernel_sources() wrote for <t>
#   and fails the build when a named source is absent from it, or when the file
#   registered under a key is not the file at the authored location the
#   descriptor's provenance records.
#
#   A descriptor resolves its own source root from its provenance.source_label,
#   through the registry hkp_wire_pack_target() fills. The step joins that root
#   with the descriptor's rel_dir and source_file, and compares the whole path
#   against the registered one. Every wired label goes to every call site, so a
#   descriptor written by a pack no PACK_NAMES value lists still resolves.
#
#   PACK_NAMES lists the pack roots that write STAGED_DESCRIPTOR_ROOTS. Each one
#   contributes its stamp file twice: as a dependency, so packing a root reruns
#   the check, and as an argument, so the step also fails when a stamped pack
#   root holds no descriptor at all. A name whose root is not wired contributes
#   neither, so a dormant root -- one with an empty source root, or with nothing to
#   pack for this build -- is not held to that rule.
#
#   An absent root, an empty root, a root with no embedded_source descriptor and
#   an empty key table each pass. A root emptied after its pack stamped it does not.
#
#   The comparison runs one way, from a staged descriptor to the table. A key no
#   descriptor names is not an error, and neither is a descriptor no pack stages.
#   The tool's docstring records why neither reverse direction can be turned on
#   while the descriptor and the embedding declaration are written independently.

#   hkp_finalize_census_install() only visits architectures listed in
#   HKP_CENSUS_SHARD_ARCHES. An architecture carrying engine-pinned external entries but
#   no census would otherwise never be visited and its entries would be dropped without a
#   word.
#
#   Reserving an architecture that turns out to hold nothing is harmless -- the finalizer
#   skips a shard with no content of any kind.

# hkp_finalize_census_install(COMMON_TEST_FILE <file> BINDIR <dir> PLUGIN_ENGINE_DIR <dir>)
#   Materialise the installed census: one CTest file per architecture that actually has
#   entries, plus the stub in the common entrypoint that finds them. The stub is written
#   even when this configuration has no shard architecture at all: it is arch-neutral, and
#   an install may pair this build's common CTest file with shards another build produced,
#   so the common file must not depend on this build's GPU targets.
#
#   Call once, AFTER every hkp_register_census_tests() has run and after <file> exists.
#   The registrations happen in a test subdirectory that is added before the common file
#   is created, so they accumulate into global properties and this drains them; appending
#   directly from the registration site would write into a file that does not exist yet.
#
#   Shard files are written into the test descriptor BUILD tree, which an existing
#   install(DIRECTORY) already ships wholesale to
#   <plugin-engine-dir>/test_arch_content/hip-kernel-provider. Their destination is
#   therefore reached without a second install rule, and an architecture pruned out of an
#   artifact takes its CTest file with it.
#
#   Discovery is a working-directory-relative glob plus subdirs(), deliberately. It must
#   survive the prefix being moved, so it cannot hold a configure-time absolute path; and
#   CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR and friends are unset when CTest reads these files, so the
#   relative form is not merely tidier, it is the only one that resolves. Discovery keys
#   on a materialised CTest file and nothing else.
