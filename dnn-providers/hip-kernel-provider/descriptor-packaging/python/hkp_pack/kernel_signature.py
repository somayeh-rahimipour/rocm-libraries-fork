"""Kernel argument signatures, read out of the compiled code object.

The signature a descriptor records is derived from the object the packer just
compiled, never typed by a kernel author. A hand-authored arity restates the
same assumption that drifted -- the author edits the kernel and updates the
descriptor, or does neither -- so it catches typos and nothing else.

What the producer stores differs by kind, and both shapes appear in this tree:
hipcc `--genco` emits a clang offload bundle wrapping the device ELF, while the
ASM producers store a bare ELF. Sniff, do not assume.

Argument NAMES are producer-dependent: clang emits `.args[].name` for OpenCL,
where names are part of the ABI, and omits it for HIP `extern "C" __global__`
kernels, so every kernel on the `hip` path here has `name: None`. The ASM/aiter
objects do carry them. They are recorded when present and omitted when not.
