    Resolves `name` **relative to the descriptor that named it** --
    `source_root / rel_dir / name` -- and requires the result to be a file
    inside the root. `label` names the field in the messages ("source" for a
    hip UKD, "hsaco file" for an authored code object); `where`, when given,
    prefixes them with the descriptor.

    Resolution is descriptor-relative only, with no root-relative fallback. A
    fallback would fire exactly when the descriptor-local file is missing, so a
    typo in the name would stop being an error and instead bind silently to a
    same-named file elsewhere in the tree. Sharing one file between sibling
    folders stays expressible by saying so: `"../shared/Kernel.cpp"`. `..`
    segments collapse lexically before symlinks are followed, so a name means
    the same file on every platform. The resolved path must stay inside the
    root.

    Missing file -> '<label> not found'; a path leaving the root -> '<label>
    escapes the source root'; a name the OS cannot resolve (NUL byte, over-long
    component) -> '<label> cannot be resolved'. All are hard errors, never
