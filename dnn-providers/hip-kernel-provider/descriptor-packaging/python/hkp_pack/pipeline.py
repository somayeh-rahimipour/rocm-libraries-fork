    so past a few dozen the next worker costs more than the compile work it
    takes on. Measured on gfx942, a 1672-variant pack bottoms out near 48
    workers -- 19.5 s against 402 s serial -- and by 128 is back to its
    16-worker time, while peaking at 2.2 GiB throughout.

    32 is a compromise, not an optimum: the turnover moves with pack size, and
    the same host wants about 12 workers for 200 variants and 48 for 1672.
