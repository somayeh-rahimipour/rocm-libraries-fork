    Unset means `min(32, _cpu_budget())`. The cap is per-worker startup, not
    memory: a worker costs roughly 250 ms to stand up its rocke+comgr import,
    so past a few dozen the next worker costs more than the compile work it
    takes on. Measured on gfx942, a 1672-variant pack bottoms out near 48
    workers -- 19.5 s against 402 s serial -- and by 128 is back to its
    16-worker time, while peaking at 2.2 GiB throughout.

    32 is a compromise, not an optimum: the turnover moves with pack size, and
    the same host wants about 12 workers for 200 variants and 48 for 1672.
    Overshooting costs far more than undershooting -- 200 variants take 6.8 s
    on 12 workers and 16.9 s on 32 -- so the constant sits below the large-pack
    optimum deliberately.

    `HKP_PACK_JOBS=1` forces serial execution: the prewarm returns without a
    pool and the walk compiles every variant itself, which is the escape hatch
    for debugging a compile failure with a single clean traceback.

    Anything that is not an integer of 1 or more is a hard error, including `0`
    and negatives. Neither is clamped, because clamping lands them on the serial
    path: `-4` would read as "compiled on 4 workers" and run on one, and `0`
    means "auto" elsewhere in this repository while it would mean "serial" here.

    An explicit value is never reduced to `_cpu_budget()` -- choosing to

    Loads the one source root once — recursively, preserving each descriptor's
    authored subpath — then for each arch compiles the targeting KDPs' variants,
    prunes, and packs. Producer selection is per-UKD on `kernel_source.kind`, so
    hip and rocKE descriptors coexist under one root (in child folders that scope
    them) and combine into one kpack per arch. A hip UKD's source resolves
    relative to the descriptor that named it. An hsaco UKD's `file` resolves the
    same way, and its prebuilt bytes are packed as-is into the same kpack. A UKD
    of a pass-through kind runs no producer and is emitted as authored, so a
    root that holds only pass-through UKDs writes descriptors and no archive. An arch with no
    surviving KDP is skipped cleanly (no folder, no kpack) and logged with 'no
    kernels for <arch>, skipping'; every arch skipping packs nothing, which is a
    clean skip too. Empty arch list installs nothing (exit 0).

    `exclude_folders` names top-level child folders of the root this build does
    not pack, and `disabled_kinds` the kernel_source kinds it has no producer for;
    both are pruned at load (load_flat_input) exactly as arch pruning prunes, so
    nothing downstream sees them.
