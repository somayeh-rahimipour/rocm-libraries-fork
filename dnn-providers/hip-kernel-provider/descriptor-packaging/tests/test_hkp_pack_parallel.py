    Standard library only, and no interpreter state is touched, so the whole

    `hip_only=True` omits the two rocke cases (an inline rocke UKD and a KDP
    referencing a standalone rocke one). Outside pytest there is no stub for the
    rocke compiler, so a rocke UKD would reach comgr for real. Every other case
    stays: the variant-key dedup pair and the shared standalone UKD are authored
    hip precisely so the subset keeps them.

    `with_embedded=True` appends the two embedded_source cases. It is purely
    additive: the default corpus, and the `hip_only` subset of it, are what
    every other consumer here pins.

    The cases, in the order the loader sees them (`sorted(rglob("*.json"))`):

    1.  c01 -- a KDP whose arch excludes the target, carrying a standalone-UKD
        ref whose own (wildcard) arch matches. The KDP-level filter must
        short-circuit the standalone branch, so the ref is expected ABSENT.

    3.  c03 -- a matching KDP with an inline rocke UKD.
    4.  c04 -- a matching KDP with one admitted inline UKD and one whose own

    5.  c05 -- a matching KDP referencing a standalone hip UKD by id.
    6.  c06 -- a matching KDP referencing a standalone rocke UKD by id.
    7.  c07 -- a matching KDP referencing a standalone UKD whose own arch
        excludes the target, plus an admitted inline UKD so the KDP survives.
    8.  c08 -- two entries that hash to the same variant key.
    9.  c09a / c09b -- one standalone UKD referenced from two KDPs: listed by
        both, compiled once.
    10. an orphan standalone UKD no KDP references. Legal, warns, packs on, and
        is expected ABSENT from the selection.

    13. c13 -- a matching KDP referencing a standalone embedded_source UKD
