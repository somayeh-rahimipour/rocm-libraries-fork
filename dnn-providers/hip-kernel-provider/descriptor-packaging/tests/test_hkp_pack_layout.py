"""Nested-layout behaviour for the single authored source root.

There is exactly ONE source root. Child folders under it scope the content
(a `hip/` tree, a `rocKE/` tree, per-integration folders beneath those), and
each descriptor's authored subpath is preserved verbatim into the staged and
installed trees. Producer selection is per-UKD on `kernel_source.kind`, never
per-folder.

The invariants this file holds: whole-set id validation, descriptor-relative
hip source resolution, path-preserving output, per-arch atomicity, toolchain
provenance, and the refusal of rocKE descriptors by a build without rocKE. The
rocKE producer's half of the layout (hip+rocKE coexistence in one kpack, the
example tree's rocKE subtree) is held in `tests/rocke/test_hkp_pack_layout_rocke.py`.
