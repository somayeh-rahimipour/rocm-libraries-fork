"""The desk-check invariants of RUNBOOK §4's host boundary, as a real, runnable CLI.

    python3 tools/hkp_desk_check.py --mode structural <path/to/*.kdp.json>
    python3 tools/hkp_desk_check.py --mode full <path/to/shipped.kdp.json>

`--mode structural` reads the descriptors against themselves and each other: drift
between metadata and the authored spec, duplicate matcher tuples, toc_key
uniqueness, symbol tolerance. It never reports compiled agreement. It accepts an
authored (`kernel_source.spec`) or shipped (`provenance.spec`) KDP, since the drift
check falls back between the two.

A descriptor is packed when its directory holds the packer's `hkp-packed.marker`;
any other is authored. A packed tree's per-UKD provenance is read from each
descriptor's sidecar (`foo.kdp.json` -> `foo.kdp.provenance.json.gz`). A missing
sidecar or entry, or a binding that does not hold, fails the run, as does an
authored tree holding a `kpack` UKD. `--provenance-root` names where a packed
tree's sidecars live when they are not beside the descriptors, as in an installed
production tree, which ships none.

`--mode full` additionally binds every kernel to the producing compiler's
`provenance.effective_spec` record and to the archive bytes the descriptor names:
declaration, metadata, KMD schema, KDP header, effective arch, captured symbol and
payload SHA256 must all agree with what the compiler observed. A missing,
unsupported or mismatched record is a FAILURE. Nothing imports rocKE, so a valid
artifact verifies where the producer was never installed. It needs the packed
dialect: a non-kpack kernel fails, the same refusal `verify_variant_sets` makes.

A packed non-rocKE kernel whose declaration lists no specialized metadata field is
reported NOT VERIFIED HERE, never folded into the agreement line: only rocKE-origin
kernels carry compiled-specialization evidence today. A kernel whose
`provenance.origin_kind` is `rocke` cannot reach that report -- the packer published
its `effective_spec` -- so declaring no specialized field AND carrying no record is
a FAILURE. An ABSENT `origin_kind` is not rocKE.

Standalone-UKD id references in a KDP's `kernelDescriptors` resolve against the
shard, the same hop `verify_variant_sets` makes.

The mode is REQUIRED: a default would let a structural run read as a full one.

Exits 0 when every enforced invariant is clean, 1 when any is violated or could not
be checked (see `hkp_pack.desk_check.DeskCheckReport.ok`). Symbol non-uniqueness is
informational and never causes a non-zero exit on its own.
