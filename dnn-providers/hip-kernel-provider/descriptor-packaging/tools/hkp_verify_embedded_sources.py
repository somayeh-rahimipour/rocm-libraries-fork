"""Check a binary's embedded kernel sources against the descriptors it serves.

A staged descriptor tree holds descriptor JSON only. The packer copies no kernel
source into it, so an `embedded_source` descriptor resolves its `source_file`
against a table the build compiles into the binary. Nothing in the staged tree
proves that table holds the named source.

This reads the key table the build wrote and every `embedded_source` descriptor
under the staged roots the binary serves, and compares the two:

  presence  Each named `source_file` is a key of the table.
  location  The file registered under that key is the file at the authored
            location the descriptor's provenance records. The check joins the
            source root of the descriptor's `provenance.source_label` with its
            `rel_dir` and its `source_file`, then compares that whole path
            against the registered one.

The check runs over emitted JSON alone. It imports no part of the packer, so it
restates the contract instead of recomputing one side of it from the other.

Every root is optional. An absent root, an empty root, a root with no
`embedded_source` descriptor and an absent key table each pass. A pass reports
the two counts it compared, so a pass over nothing reads differently in the
build log from a step that did not run.

One further rule keys on a pack stamp rather than on the comparison above:

  non-empty  A pack root whose stamp file is present holds at least one
             descriptor. The stamp lives inside the root it vouches for, so its
             presence is the build's own claim that this root was packed, and a
             packed root that holds nothing was emptied afterwards.

`--pack-stamp` names the stamps to hold to that rule, one per wired pack. A root
whose pack is not wired -- the dormant production root is one -- contributes no
stamp and is not checked.

The comparison runs one way, from a staged descriptor to the table. Neither
reverse direction is checked.

A key the table holds that no descriptor names is not an error. Most embedded
kernels have no descriptor at all: the hip_mlops engine resolves its sources by
name, as do the compile and cache tests, so requiring a descriptor per key would
fail on correct code. A rule covering only descriptor-backed keys would have to
be asked for where the kernel is registered, and nothing distinguishes the two
kinds there today.

A descriptor that never reaches a staged root is not an error either. Authored
under a folder no pack is wired to, it is never staged, so this walk never sees
it and passes while the runtime never receives it. Catching that needs the
authored tree as a second input, which provenance cannot supply, because the
packer is what writes provenance.

Both gaps exist because the descriptor and the embedding declaration are written
independently. A build that derived one from the other would leave nothing for
either direction to catch.
