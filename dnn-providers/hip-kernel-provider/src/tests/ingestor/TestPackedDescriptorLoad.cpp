/**
 * @file TestPackedDescriptorLoad.cpp
 * @brief The packer/loader seam: real packer OUTPUT read by the real loader.
 *
 * Every other test on this boundary sees only one side of it. The pytest suite under
 * `descriptor-packaging/` validates the packer against the packer's own model of what it
 * emitted, and `TestDescriptorLoader.cpp` validates the loader against JSON a C++ test
 * typed out by hand -- including two cases whose own comments say they mirror
 * `pipeline.py::_rewrite_ukd_kpack`, which is a copy of the shape, not the shape itself.
 * Nothing ran the bytes the packer actually wrote through the parser that has to read
 * them.
 *
 * Two blocking defects have already lived in exactly that gap and survived a fully green
 * suite:
 *
 *   * `library` was written arch-root-relative and read descriptor-relative, so every
 *     NESTED descriptor named an archive that was not there. It resolved only for a
 *     descriptor sitting flat at the arch root -- which was every layout that existed
 *     before path preservation made nesting normal.
 *   * a descriptor tree was authored to an invented schema (version `0.1`, non-UUID ids,
 *     wrong per-type field names), so zero descriptors would have loaded.
 *
 * Both are data-shape errors only a real load can see. The cases below are written to
 * fail if either is reintroduced.
 *
 * No device is required: the staged tree is on disk whether or not this machine has a
 * GPU, so this runs in every configuration that packs anything.
