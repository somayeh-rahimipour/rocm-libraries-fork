"""Offline consumer for ``--emit-support-observations`` snapshots (RFC 0015 §12).

A run of the integration-test binary observes, for every graph it registers and
every engine loaded into the handle, whether that engine accepts the graph on
the machine the run happened on.  ``--emit-support-observations`` writes a
single snapshot JSON to stdout at the end of the run.  This tool reads one or
more snapshot files, compares them against the ``.support.json`` sidecars
committed to the tree, and proposes the lines the sidecars are missing.

Why an offline consumer at all
------------------------------
One CI run sees one ASIC on one OS, and usually only a shard of the bundles.
A sidecar has to hold the union across every ASIC, so no single run is in a
position to rewrite one -- it would erase the targets it did not visit.
Unioning the snapshots from every shard first, and only then diffing, is what
makes the update safe to compute.  ``--write-support-claims`` (the C++ bootstrap
path) rewrites sidecars in place from a single run precisely because it is
*not* this: it is the one-machine tool you point at an empty tree.

What it will and will not propose
---------------------------------
The merge is monotonic and optimistic, in both directions of that word:

* ``supported`` from any run wins over ``declined`` from any other.  Engines
  are allowed to be flaky and shards are allowed to be stale; a target that
  accepted the graph once can accept it, and the claim is a statement about
  capability rather than about a particular afternoon.
* ``unknown`` is discarded outright.  A query that errored, crashed, or timed
  out is not evidence of anything -- treating it as a decline is how a driver
  fault turns into a silent claim deletion.
* A committed ``supported`` claim is never removed or downgraded.  When a run
  reports ``declined`` for a cell the tree claims, that is reported as a
  conflict for a human to read and left alone.  Automatic downgrades would let
  one bad shard delete a matrix column.
* A ``declined`` observation on an unclaimed cell writes nothing.  Absence
  already means "not asserted"; there is no negative claim to record.

The output is a directory of proposed sidecars, never an edit in place.  The
committed tree is only ever read here -- the human gate is the point (RFC 0015
§12.3), and a tool that can write to the tree is a tool that can be wired into
a CI job that commits to it.

Canonical form
--------------
Proposed sidecars are serialised exactly as ``dumpCanonical()`` does in
``SupportClaims.cpp`` -- sorted keys, two-space indent, trailing newline -- and
sweep groups are rebuilt exactly as ``regroupSweepClaims()`` does in
``SupportClaimWriter.cpp``.  Both matter for the same reason: a proposal that
reformats a file it did not otherwise change buries one added platform token in
a hundred lines of churn.  A sidecar already in canonical form round-trips
through this tool untouched.

Usage
-----
    python3 harvest_support_observations.py \\
        --observations snapshot-1.json snapshot-2.json \\
        --bundles-dir integration-test-bundles \\
        --output-dir /tmp/proposed-sidecars

Add ``--dry-run`` to print the diff without writing, and ``--coverage-report``
for the per-ASIC table of how much of the tree the runs actually visited.

Exit codes
----------
0  Ran to completion (conflicts and skipped records are warnings, not failures;
   the tool's job is to report, and a non-zero exit here would block the very
   pipeline meant to surface them).
1  Could not run: no readable observation file, or the output could not be
   written.
