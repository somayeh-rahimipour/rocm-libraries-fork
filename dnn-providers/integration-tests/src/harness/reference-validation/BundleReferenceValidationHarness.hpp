/// harness. Verifying an engine and verifying our own golden data are different
/// jobs with different failure meanings, and folding the second into the first is
/// what produced a "verification mode" that structurally never reached an engine —
/// and therefore never checked the claims the engine harness exists to enforce.
///
/// **There is no verification skip path.** Registration only creates a test when
/// the bundle has golden data *and* every node type is in this reference's
/// required-op set (see ReferenceOpCoverage.hpp). Given that, a reference that
/// cannot run the graph is a gap in the reference, so it fails rather than skips.
/// The one skip is device availability, checked before that gate: the GPU
/// reference needs a device, so its suite skips on a runner that has none.
///
/// A bundle named in knownReferenceGaps() is the sole exception, and it is still
/// not a skip: the test runs and asserts the reference reports the graph
/// *inapplicable*. Closing the gap therefore turns that test red until its entry
/// is removed.
