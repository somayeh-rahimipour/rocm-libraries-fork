// it would bury real verdicts. UNCLAIMED_SUPPORT means the file is out of
// date (a line to add); NO_SIDECAR means nobody opted this graph in at all.
//
// executeGraphThroughEngine: verdict does not decide whether the graph runs;
//   CLAIM_BROKEN / QUERY_ERRORED FAIL where the run would previously have skipped.
// enforceAtLevel: NO_SIDECAR / NOT_ENFORCED → skipUnverifiable (no vacuous pass).

    // They are not redundant with the verdict, because an unresolved query only
    // becomes QUERY_ERRORED when the cell is *claimed*. Unclaimed and unresolved is
    // NOT_ENFORCED — the same verdict as a healthy "this engine simply does not do
    // this graph". A driver fault and a routine decline are indistinguishable by
    // verdict alone, and on a bootstrap run, where nothing is claimed yet, every
    // error lands in exactly that bucket. Holding the code as a field is what lets a
    // consumer separate the two, group errors by kind, and compare one node against
    // another (a graph-level code must be identical everywhere; divergence across
    // nodes means it is not the bundle).
    //
    // `queryStatus` is always the code the caller observed, even on the NO_SIDECAR
    // short-circuit where the verdict does not consult it. It defaults to OK only so
    // a default-constructed result is deterministic; evaluateSupport always sets it.
    //
    // `queryMessage` is the backend's own err_msg, stored only when the code did not
    // resolve. A resolved query has nothing to explain, and these are unbounded
    // strings — there is no reason to hold thousands of them.

// `rankedIds`    — the engine ids the query returned
// `engineId`     — the engine being checked
// `claimed`      — whether the sidecar promises support for this combo
// `hasSidecar`   — whether the bundle has a sidecar at all
// `queryMessage` — that same query's err_msg. Optional: it is a diagnostic, never
//                  an input to the verdict, so a caller holding only a code still
//                  compiles. Kept on the result only when the code did not resolve
//                  (see SupportResult::queryMessage).
//
// The two-step split (RFC 0015 §5.2):
//   1. status code → resolved (OK / GRAPH_NOT_SUPPORTED) vs unresolved
//   2. ranked-list membership → supported vs declined
//
// Resolved + present  → SUPPORTED
// Resolved + absent   → DECLINED
// Unresolved          → unknown (query broke, cannot evaluate)
//
// Then combined with the claim:
//   !hasSidecar         → NO_SIDECAR (short-circuits; the query is not even read)
//   claimed + SUPPORTED → SATISFIED
//   claimed + DECLINED  → CLAIM_BROKEN
//   claimed + unknown   → QUERY_ERRORED
//   unclaimed + SUPPORTED → UNCLAIMED_SUPPORT
//   everything else     → NOT_ENFORCED
