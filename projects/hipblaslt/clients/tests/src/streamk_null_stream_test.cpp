// Regression test for the legacy null stream losing its Stream-K flag block.
//
// Keyed on the raw hipStream_t the null stream's key is nullptr, which the claim
// loop in streamKFlagsForStream() also uses to mean "block free": the CAS stores
// nullptr into a block that already holds nullptr, the block stays free, and the
// null stream aliases whichever stream claims it next.
//
// Asserted here as accounting rather than by running that alias into the
// deadlock it causes. rocblaslt_matmul_impl claims a block for every matmul,
// before it knows the solution, and refuses the call once the handle's blocks
// are all taken -- so the number of distinct streams a handle serves before its
// first refusal counts the blocks that handle has spent. Two handles are
// counted: one handed nothing but fresh explicit streams, one handed a
// null-stream matmul first. Repeated null-stream calls must cost exactly one
// block, so the second count has to come out one lower. Before the fix it cost nothing and the
// two counts were equal.
//
// The claim is unconditional, so no Stream-K solution is needed and the shape
// can be small. Nothing runs concurrently, so nothing here can hang whether the
// library keys the null stream apart or not.
