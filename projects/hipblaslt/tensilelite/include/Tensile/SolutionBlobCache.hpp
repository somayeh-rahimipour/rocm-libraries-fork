 * \ingroup SolutionLibrary
 *
 * Holds the unparsed solution bytes of an indexed (`format_version: 2`)
 * library file plus a table describing where each solution lives, and
 * deserializes individual solutions on demand.
 *
 * A typical GEMM touches a handful of the thousands of solutions in a file,
 * so parsing them all at load time is almost entirely wasted work. Leaf nodes
 * of the library tree hold a shared_ptr to this cache and an index, and only
 * materialize when a query actually selects them.
 *
 * The blob is owned rather than referenced. Pointing into the msgpack zone
 * would be zero-copy but ties the cache's validity to loader internals that
 * differ across supported msgpack versions, and would pin the whole parsed
 * object graph rather than just these bytes.
 *
 * Deserialization is injected as a callable rather than called directly. This
 * header is compiled into both the msgpack and LLVM-YAML backends, which are
 * mutually exclusive at link time (`src/CMakeLists.txt`), so referring to
 * msgpack here would break the YAML build even though it never reads an
 * indexed file. It also lets tests drive the cache with a stub.
