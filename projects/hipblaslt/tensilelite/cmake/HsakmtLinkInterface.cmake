# Repair for the link interface ROCm 7.x's hsakmtTargets.cmake exports.
#
# That file bakes BUILD-HOST absolute paths into hsakmt::hsakmt's
# INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES, which do not exist on a fresh container, so every
# executable linking hsakmt fails. Two forms appear:
#   * an absolute /usr/lib64/libc.so entry -> make reports "No rule to make
#     target '/usr/lib64/libc.so'" (libc is linked implicitly anyway), and
#   * a `-L/home/runner/.../rocm_sysdeps/lib` search dir feeding `-ldrm` /
#     `-ldrm_amdgpu` -> ld.lld "unable to find library -ldrm".
# The libdrm/numa the interface wants are vendored in
# ${ROCM_PATH}/lib/rocm_sysdeps/lib on such a container.
#

#   Drops phantom libc entries and repoints dead `-L` search dirs at
#   <sysdeps_lib>, writing the result to <out_var> in the caller's scope.
#   <in_list_var> is the NAME of the list variable to read, not its value.
#
# Entries that are already correct are returned untouched, so on a normally
# installed ROCm -- where the exported paths are live and there may be no
# vendored sysdeps dir at all -- this is a no-op.
