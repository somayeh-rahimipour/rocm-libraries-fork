ValidCorpusConsistency
---
Cross-file consistency checks for the library logic tree, run by
``TensileLogic --check-all`` in addition to the existing per-file/per-solution
validators.

These checks are different in kind from the other ``Valid*.py`` validators:
they are cheap (header-only YAML reads -- no per-solution parsing) but need
visibility across more than one file to do their job. Both checks below are
scoped the same way the caller's own per-solution validation already is: to
the files ``TensileLogic`` selected for the requested ``--architecture``
(the full corpus when ``--architecture all`` is given). There's no separate
"whole corpus" mode here -- if a gfx942-only build doesn't touch gfx1250
data, a gfx1250-only violation should not fail it.

No known-bugs / quarantine escape hatch exists for these checks (unlike the
per-solution validators, which can accept a documented ``known_bugs.yaml``
entry). A violation here is always a hard failure. If a future violation
needs a documented, temporary exception, extend the known-bugs schema (see
``KnownBugs.py``) deliberately -- do not assume one already covers these
checks.
