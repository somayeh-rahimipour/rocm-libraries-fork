"""Unit tests for config_helpers.configMarks FFM-conditional xfail.

A config marked ``ffm_fail`` passes on real hardware but fails only under
FFM emulation. configMarks turns that mark into an ``xfail`` exclusively
when running under FFM — keyed on the emulator's ``HSA_MODEL_MEMFILE``
backing plus the gfx1250 arch — so it stays inert on hardware and on
other arches, where the test must still run.
