"""Unit tests for the gfx1250 stepping split via a distinct architecture name.

gfx1250 ships in two steppings that report the same ISA but are separate compiler
targets. v0 is modelled as the architecture name ``gfx1250-strict``; v1 keeps the
plain ``gfx1250`` name. Both canonicalize to ``IsaVersion(12,5,0)``, so the
stepping is invisible below the build's capability map and has to be carried by
name to reach the assembler as ``-mcpu=gfx1250-strict``. Getting that wrong is not
cosmetic: the two targets emit different ELF machine codes (0xEB and 0x49) and
their code objects will not load on each other's silicon.

Because the two steppings are indistinguishable by ISA, the assembler-probed
capability table cannot tell them apart. The v0 deltas are therefore *declared*
in ``ARCH_CAP_OVERRIDES`` and applied on top of the probed caps, which turns the
two silicon differences v0 has to express -- no TDM-multicast, no fp4 32x16 WMMA
-- into ordinary capability reads in Solution derivation.

There is deliberately no solution parameter and no kernel-name difference: one
build targets exactly one stepping, so same-named kernels never coexist.

The tests that derive real solutions need gfx1250 capabilities (``amdclang++``
targeting gfx1250) and are skipped when the toolchain is unavailable.
