"""Tests for planGRCoopSpread, the TLU=1 cooperative global-read fetch planner.

The bulk of this file is an equivalence check against a verbatim copy of the
algorithm as it lived inline in Kernel.py before extraction. Behaviour is pinned
by comparison rather than by hand-written expectations, so the move can be shown
to change nothing across the input space.

Keep `_originalInline` frozen. If the planner is intentionally changed later,
this test is expected to fail; record which cases moved and why rather than
editing the reference to match.
