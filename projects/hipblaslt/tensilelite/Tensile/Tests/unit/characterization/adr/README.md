# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory holds the **Architecture Decision Records** for the TensileLite characterization suite: one short file per genuine decision, in [Michael Nygard's](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) format. An ADR captures *why* a decision was made, so a future reader — or a reviewer of a PR that touches the tests or goldens next to it — can recover the intent without archaeology.

See the characterization [`README.md`](../README.md) for the suite protocol and the snapshot/golden discipline; this file covers only the ADR mechanics.

## When to write an ADR

Write one for a genuine decision fork, e.g.:
- **Pinning a known-wrong behavior** — assert the current crash/wrong result instead of "fixing" it in a characterization test (the suite is add-only). The ADR records the bug and links a filed defect that tracks the real fix.
- **Accepting a module below the coverage bar** for a structural reason (fork/IPC paths, GPU/asm emit, integration-only builders).
- **A departure from the add-only rule** (e.g. deleting verified-dead source).
- **A legitimate bulk `.ambr` golden regeneration** (e.g. an intended change to the snapshot format itself) — see `Bulk-Snapshot-Update:` under Format below. This is the one ADR trigger that is about the *mechanics* of a change (how many goldens moved) rather than the behavior a golden pins; it exists because CI's `check_snapshot_diff.py` (AIHPBLAS-3876) enforces it mechanically.

Routine "wrote tests, hit the bar, committed" steps are **not** ADRs. Neither are accepted-equivalent mutants — a genuinely unkillable mutation survivor gets a one-line `# pragma: no mutate` plus a line in `DECISIONS.md`'s Mutation testing section, not a full ADR (see the characterization `README.md`'s ADR section for why).

The running catalog of pinned behaviors, coverage ceilings, and accepted mutants lives in [`../DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md) (the registry); an ADR is the per-decision rationale behind a catalog entry, and **only** the rationale — the catalog row itself should stay to a title, an `ADR:`/`Defect:` link, and a one-to-two sentence summary, not a restatement of the ADR's Context/Decision/Consequences.

## Format

- One file per decision, named `NNNN-short-slug.md` (zero-padded, monotonic) — e.g. `0001-pin-results-only-boolop-crash.md`.
- Nygard sections: **Status**, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**. Add a `Defect:` line when the decision pins a behavior that looks wrong.
- **Status** is one of `Proposed`, `Accepted`, or `Superseded by adr/NNNN`.
- **Append-only.** Never rewrite an accepted ADR's decision. If the world changes (e.g. a pinned bug is fixed and its golden flips), write a *new* ADR that supersedes the old one and set the old one's status to `Superseded by adr/NNNN`.
- **`Commit:` is a backfill-only field, not a template requirement.** An ADR written in the same PR as its decision doesn't need one — that PR's own commit(s) already are the provenance, and you can't know your own commit's SHA before it exists anyway. It exists only for retrofitted ADRs written after the fact (like ADRs 0004-0011, written well after their decisions), where the ADR's authoring commit and the decision's actual commit are two different things and that gap needs to be spelled out explicitly. When present, point it at the commit that made the real change (test/code), not the commit that wrote the ADR file — check with `git log -S` / `git blame` on `DECISIONS.md`, and if the repo squash-merges PRs, fetch the PR's pre-squash history (`git fetch origin refs/pull/<n>/head`) to find the real per-decision commit instead of citing the one shared squash commit for everything that PR touched.
- **`Bulk-Snapshot-Update: yes` is an override marker, not a template requirement.** It exists for exactly one situation: a PR's `.ambr` diff spans more files than CI's blanket-regeneration guard (`characterization/tools/check_snapshot_diff.py`, AIHPBLAS-3876) allows, and the change is a genuine, reviewed mass update rather than an accidental or forced-green `--snapshot-update`. Add or update an ADR in the *same PR* carrying this line on its own (case-insensitive) — the guard greps the ADR's content at the PR's head commit for it. Omit the line entirely for every other ADR; its mere presence is what grants the override, so don't add it out of habit. This is a mechanics/process field like `Commit:`, not a Nygard section — it does not replace `Status`/`Context`/`Decision`/`Consequences`, which must still explain *why* the bulk change is correct.

## Template

```markdown
# ADR NNNN: <short title>

Status:  Accepted
Defect:  <TRACKER-ID, or "none — behavior is intended">
Commit:  <only for a retrofitted ADR — omit this line entirely otherwise>
Bulk-Snapshot-Update:  <only to override the blanket-regeneration CI guard — omit otherwise>

## Context
<What forced a decision? The behavior observed, why it is ambiguous or
costly, and the constraints (e.g. add-only).>

## Decision
<What we decided to do, in one or two sentences.>

## Consequences
<What this costs and enables, and what a future change must do to revisit
it — e.g. "if the defect is fixed, flip the golden and supersede this ADR".>
```
