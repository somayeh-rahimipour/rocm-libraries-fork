# Decision log — TensileLite characterization

The durable record of *why* the characterization suite looks the way it does:
which modules are deliberately left below the coverage bar, which behaviors are
pinned as latent bugs rather than "fixed" in a characterization test, which
mutants are accepted as equivalent, and the few places this departed from the
add-only rule. A reviewer of any future TensileLite change should be able to
read this file and understand the intent behind the tests next to it.

One entry per non-trivial decision: the choice made, why, and why the
alternatives were rejected. Routine "wrote tests, hit the bar, committed" steps
are **not** logged — only genuine forks.

See `README.md` (this directory) for the per-module protocol and how to run the
suite. Additional background is tracked under AIHPBLAS-3871.

---

## D0 — Scope of "every remaining module"
**Decision:** Characterize the pure / table / IO / config / toolchain-helper
Python surface; **exclude** the codegen/asm/GPU modules (KernelWriter*,
Components/*, Asm*, GenerateSummations, verify_stinky*, ClientWriter) and
**defer** Solution.py slice-3b (derivation config matrix).
**Why:** the excluded set (~38k stmts) emits GPU assembly / drives the full
build; it is not unit-characterizable without a GPU + toolchain pipeline (rated
★ lowest fit in the original MODULE MAP). Snapshotting their structure would be
brittle and low-value.
**Alternatives rejected:** (a) attempt the kernel writers with heavy mocking —
rejected: the mocks would assert our own scaffolding, not real behaviour, and
would break on every codegen change; (b) include them as 0%-and-documented
stubs — rejected: adds empty dirs with no value. These are listed OUT of scope
in the plan, not silently skipped.

## D1 — Per-module coverage measurement (suite-alone) vs full `-m unit` each time
**Decision:** Measure each module with a fast **suite-alone** `--cov` run; run
the full `-m unit` no-regression gate **once per batch** (and capture a fresh
baseline) rather than once per module.
**Why:** the full suite is ~110s; doing it per module across ~44 modules would
add hours with no extra signal (a new add-only test dir cannot reduce another
module's coverage). Per-batch is enough to catch any accidental import-time
regression.
**Alternative rejected:** full run per module — rejected on cost; the add-only
constraint makes per-module regression practically impossible.

## D2 — Trivial-module doc overhead
**Decision:** For small modules that hit ~100% cleanly, write a single compact
`target.md` (before→after + any resistance inline) and skip separate
`resistance.md`/`recommendations.md`; commit one atomic commit per module.
**Why:** keeps the per-module-commit requirement without ceremony that adds no
information for a trivial 100% module.
**Alternative rejected:** the full 5-file deliverable per module (as used for the
large standalone targets) — rejected as disproportionate for 9-60 stmt modules.

## D3 — Testing `Component` find/match without polluting the global registry
**Decision:** Define private isolated `_CharBase`/`_CharNest*` Component
subclasses in the test module to drive `matches`/`findAll`/`find`/`versions`
(single-match, >1-match RuntimeError, nested-abstract recursion) deterministically;
test `LocalRead._getLdsReadMemToken`/`_emitLdsRead` by calling them **unbound**
with stub self/writer/module (no subclass needed).
**Why:** `ComponentMeta` auto-registers every subclass into its base's
`implementations`. Production searches always start at a real subtype
(`Component.<RealSubtype>.find`), never at `Component.findAll`, so private impls
parented at `Component`/`_CharBase` never appear in a real search — the mutation
is additive and inert. The unbound-call trick covers the codegen LocalRead
helpers without registering a concrete LocalRead (which would join the real
LocalRead search set).
**Alternatives rejected:** (a) exercise the real registered components with a
fake writer — rejected: match results are nondeterministic across environments
and the >1-match error can't be forced reliably; (b) register a concrete
LocalRead subclass — rejected: it would pollute the real `LocalRead`
implementations set used by the kernel writers. Also note the
`from .Components import *` at the end of `Component.py` shadows the module-level
`LocalRead` name, so the real class is reached via the `Component.LocalRead`
attribute.

## D4 — `Common/Parallel.py`: accept <95% (fork/process-pool paths)

**ADR:** [`adr/0004-accept-parallel-below-coverage-bar.md`](adr/0004-accept-parallel-below-coverage-bar.md)

**Decision:** Characterize the pure helpers + single-threaded + `n_jobs=1` in-process paths (→ ~81% line); accept the real fork/spawn `multiprocessing.Pool` / `ProcessPoolExecutor` / Windows-only paths as out of reach for a flake-free unit test.

## D5 — recurring submodule-shadowing gotcha
**Observation (not a fork, but recorded):** several `Tensile` packages re-export
a class that shadows a same-named submodule attribute, so
`import Tensile.X.Foo as F` binds the *class*, not the module. Hit for
`SolutionStructs.Solution`, `Component` (LocalRead), and `Common.Parallel`
(joblib `Parallel`). **Standard fix applied everywhere:**
`F = importlib.import_module("Tensile.X.Foo")`.

## D6 — `KernelHelperNaming.py`: cover the naming half, accept <95%

**ADR:** [`adr/0005-accept-kernelhelpernaming-below-coverage-bar.md`](adr/0005-accept-kernelhelpernaming-below-coverage-bar.md)

**Decision:** Characterize the pure naming/orchestration surface (`KernelHelperEnum`, `kernelObjectNameCallables`, the five `*Names` functions); accept the `init*` `KernelWriter*`-construction functions (out-of-scope codegen, see D0) as uncovered — module lands at ~34% line.

## D9 — `Configuration.py`: operators/ProjectConfig covered; AST evaluator deferred

**ADR:** [`adr/0006-accept-configuration-below-coverage-bar.md`](adr/0006-accept-configuration-below-coverage-bar.md)

**Decision:** Cover the `Parameter` operator surface, `ReadWriteTransformDict`, and `ProjectConfig`; document the dead reflected-operator branches and defer the `ExpressionEvaluator` AST-walker matrix as its own future slice. Accept `Configuration.py` <95% combined.

## D10 — `Contractions.py`: predicate/serialization matrix deferred (~86%)

**ADR:** [`adr/0007-accept-contractions-below-coverage-bar.md`](adr/0007-accept-contractions-below-coverage-bar.md)

**Decision:** Cover the index value classes, `ProblemType`, `SizeMapping`, `InternalArgsSupport`, and `ProblemPredicate.CompoundPredicates` from the one vendored gfx942-HSS fixture; accept ~86% combined and defer the other-problem-configuration predicate/state arms as a future "Contractions matrix" slice.

## D11 — `BenchmarkStructs.py`: BenchmarkProcess builder deferred

**ADR:** [`adr/0008-accept-benchmarkstructs-below-coverage-bar.md`](adr/0008-accept-benchmarkstructs-below-coverage-bar.md)

**Decision:** Cover the pure helpers, fork-permutation cartesian product, and `BenchmarkStep`; defer `BenchmarkProcess` (the config→benchmark-steps integration builder) pending an end-to-end benchmark-config fixture.

## D12 — TensileBenchmarkCluster: pin the `--results-only` constraint crash rather than asserting clean workflow steps

**ADR:** [`adr/0001-pin-results-only-boolop-crash.md`](adr/0001-pin-results-only-boolop-crash.md)

**Defect:** [`AIHPBLAS-4298`](https://amd-hub.atlassian.net/browse/AIHPBLAS-4298)

**Decision:** Pin the real `AssertionError` that `--results-only` raises today, instead of asserting the intended-but-unreachable clean workflow tuple. Root cause: `ExpressionEvaluator`'s `BoolOp` handler only evaluates the first two operands of an n-ary boolean constraint.

## D13 — Activation.py: pin the pure config/type/numeric layer only; asm codegen is out of scope

**ADR:** [`adr/0009-accept-activation-below-coverage-bar.md`](adr/0009-accept-activation-below-coverage-bar.md)

**Decision:** Characterize only the pure config/type/numeric layer (48 tests) plus asm entry-points that run cleanly with dummy vgprs; do not drive the full asm codegen. Result: 1037 stmts, 683 missed → 34.1% line, documented ceiling.

## D14 — TensileLibLogicToYaml: pin the formGroups("None") crash on the skipMI / MI-disabled path

**ADR:** [`adr/0010-pin-formgroups-none-crash.md`](adr/0010-pin-formgroups-none-crash.md)

**Defect:** [`AIHPBLAS-4409`](https://amd-hub.atlassian.net/browse/AIHPBLAS-4409)

**Decision:** Pin the real `AttributeError` that `formGroups` raises on the skipMI / MI-disabled path (a string `"None"` sentinel hits `.items()`) instead of asserting a working sentinel Group; drive the rest of the orchestrator/fork tests through the working MI-enabled path.

## D15 — TensileClientConfig: dead code, REMOVED (final)

**ADR:** [`adr/0011-remove-tensileclientconfig-dead-code.md`](adr/0011-remove-tensileclientconfig-dead-code.md)

**Decision:** Remove `TensileClientConfig` (module, launcher, and its `cmake` `VALID_BINS` entry) as verified dead code — no in-tree caller, not shipped, and unimportable since a prior refactor. A real source deletion, a deliberate one-off departure from the characterization pass's add-only rule (2026-06-03, at the user's direction). `-m unit` was 2466 passed / 201 skipped both before and after — no regression. Two earlier readings of this question reached opposite wrong conclusions before landing here; see the ADR's Context for why that history matters.

## Mutation testing — accepted equivalents & `# pragma: no mutate`

A mutant counts as killed only if the suite passes clean, fails on the mutant,
and reverts cleanly. A survivor is accepted (marked
`# pragma: no mutate`, or recorded here as equivalent) only with a one-line
justification. The mutation config lives in `[tool.mutmut]` in
`pyproject.toml`; see the **Mutation testing** section of `README.md` for how to
run it.

**M0 — pilot slice (report-only).** The first slice mutates five files only:
`Common/Utilities.py`, and the four `TensileLogic/Valid{ChipId,MatrixInstruction,
WorkGroup,WorkGroupMappingXCC}.py`. It is intentionally narrow so the workflow
(triage → kill → re-certify) is proven before widening to the critical modules.
Survivors on covered lines are killed with focused `test_mut_*_char.py`; only the
genuinely-unkillable ones below are accepted.

**M1 — accepted `# pragma: no mutate` (display-only string mutations).** Three
lines in `Common/Utilities.py` carry the pragma because the mutant only alters a
user-facing string with no observable control-flow or return-value effect, so no
characterization assertion can distinguish mutant from original:
- `:219` — `sys.stdout.write("\b" + self.chars[...])`, the progress-spinner
  animation frame (cosmetic terminal output).
- `:362` — `print("ERROR: Can't have a negative register value")`, a diagnostic
  message string.
- `:367` — `print("ERROR: Divide by 0")`, a diagnostic message string.

**M2 — accepted `# pragma: no mutate` (expanded mutation run).** These
equivalent source forms are fenced so mutmut does not keep reporting them:
- `Tensile.Common.ValidParameters.checkSpaceFillAlgoIsValid` — the
  `range(0, maxOrderID + 1)` membership check carries `# pragma: no mutate`
  because `range(0, n)` and `range(n)` produce the same values; the explicit
  lower bound documents the valid OrderID interval.
- `Tensile.Common.ValidParameters.checkSpaceFillAlgoWGMIsValid` — the
  `range(0, 256)` membership check carries `# pragma: no mutate` because
  `range(0, n)` and `range(n)` produce the same values; the explicit lower bound
  documents the half-open GridDim interval `[0, 256)`.

**M3 — accepted equivalent mutants (expanded mutation run).** These survivors
are behaviorally equivalent on the specific public surface under test:
- `Tensile.TensileLogic.ValidWorkGroupMappingXCC.x__cu_count_from_path__mutmut_9` —
  changing `cu` to `CU` inside the regex literal is equivalent because the search
  uses `re.IGNORECASE`.

Two former survivors are intentionally no longer accepted equivalents:
`Tensile.TensileLogic.ValidWorkGroupMappingXCC.x__validateWorkGroupMappingXCC__mutmut_14`
is avoided by making the missing-key / `-1` sentinel branch explicit before
reading the fixed `WorkGroupMappingXCC` value, and
`Tensile.Common.Utilities.xǁSpinnyThingǁincrement__mutmut_1` is killable because
`SpinnyThing.increment` now uses its `value` parameter to advance by caller
selected steps.

**M4 — widened mutation slice.** The `only_mutate` set in `[tool.mutmut]` was
extended past the original five files to add `Common/DataType.py`,
`Common/Types.py`, `Common/ValidParameters.py`, `SolutionStructs/Naming.py`, and
`SolutionStructs/Utilities.py`, with matching characterization directories added
to `pytest_add_cli_args_test_selection`. Source-path mapping for the widened slice:
DataType → `Tensile/Common/DataType.py`; CommonTypes → `Tensile/Common/Types.py`;
ValidParameters → `Tensile/Common/ValidParameters.py`; Naming →
`Tensile/SolutionStructs/Naming.py`; SolutionStructsUtils →
`Tensile/SolutionStructs/Utilities.py`.

**M5 — SolutionStructs Naming/Utilities mutation outcome.** `Naming.py`: 455
generated, 453 killed, 2 accepted equivalents, 0 no-test mutants → 100% covered
non-equivalent score (99.56% raw). `Utilities.py`: 131 generated, 131 killed, 0
survivors, 0 no-test mutants → 100% covered score. The full run had 30 no-test
mutants outside these two modules. Because `mutate_only_covered_lines = false`,
mutmut enumerates every source-line mutation; these scores exclude only the
explicit no-test entries and accepted equivalents.

**Pinned equivalent (Naming).**
**ADR:** [`adr/0003-pin-split-gsu-naming-crash.md`](adr/0003-pin-split-gsu-naming-crash.md).
`Tensile.SolutionStructs.Naming.x__getName__mutmut_{70,71}` changes the masked
`state["GlobalSplitU"] = "M"` expression at `Naming.py:172`; every string form
reaches the same pinned string-versus-integer `TypeError` before it can affect a
name. [`AIHPBLAS-4297`](https://amd-hub.atlassian.net/browse/AIHPBLAS-4297)
tracks this pinned defect.

The former WGMXCC and unreachable-abbreviation equivalents were removed as
redundant/dead source instead of being fenced, unlike M2's documented pragmas.
No new `# pragma: no mutate` fences are accepted in this round.

## D16 — BufferLoad/BufferStore promoted to Required Parameters
**Context** kernel basename hash changes across all archs; assembly verified unchanged/correct; no err or kernel-count changes."

## D17 — StreamKWorkStealing added to the required (min-naming) parameter set
**Decision:** Promote `StreamKWorkStealing` to the required (min-naming) parameter set in
`Common/RequiredParameters.py` and accept the regenerated `_codegen` / SolutionClass /
ValidParameters goldens.
**Why:** without it, two solutions differing only in `StreamKWorkStealing` would collide on the
same kernel identity name/hash.
**Verification:** only `basename` hashes + the `SKWS0` name token + the roster/valid-values entry
change (`num_keys` 334→335); no `err`, instruction-count, or emitted-assembly changes.

## D18 — LibraryIO dict-format raw logic snapshot addition
**Context:** `rawLibraryLogic` historically unpacked only list-format logic. A
dict-format input path was added to preserve the legacy tuple contract used by
older call sites (`versionString`, `scheduleName`, `architectureName`,
`deviceNames`, `problemTypeState`, `solutionStates`, `indexOrder`,
`exactLogic`, `rangeLogic`, `otherFields`). Characterization gained a new test
(`test_raw_library_logic_dict_format`) to pin this behavior.

**Decision:** Add a new syrupy golden node for the new test in
`LibraryIO/__snapshots__/test_logiccontract_char.ambr`.

**Why:** This is a **new characterization case**, not a rewrite of an existing
golden's meaning. The snapshot records the expected dict-format-to-legacy-tuple
mapping (including optional-field ordering in `otherFields`) so future refactors
cannot silently break backward compatibility.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- Avoid snapshot and assert piecemeal fields manually — rejected: weaker
  protection for tuple ordering/shape regressions.
- Update all snapshots wholesale — rejected by governance; only the single new
  node was generated.

## D19 — test_create_library_logic_dict_arch golden changed from list-shape to dict-shape
**Context:** Diff vs `develop` shows the snapshot node
`test_create_library_logic_dict_arch` in
`LibraryIO/__snapshots__/test_logiccontract_char.ambr` moved from a legacy
matching-table list representation to canonical dict-format library logic.

**Decision:** Keep the new dict-format golden and document it as intentional.

**Why:** The serialization contract being characterized is now dict-first for
`createLibraryLogic`, with explicit root keys (`ArchitectureName`, `CUCount`,
`DefaultSolution`, `Solutions`, `LibraryType`, etc.). The old list-shape golden
encoded the prior format and would now mask the intended migration. The new
golden also captures that for the gfx942 + CUCount!=304 branch, architecture is
materialized as `ArchitectureName` + `CUCount` in dict logic rather than a list
field tuple position.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- Revert to list-shaped snapshot for compatibility optics — rejected: it would
  assert obsolete output and fight the dict-format migration.
- Keep both shapes in one test — rejected: conflates two contracts; list-format
  coverage is already pinned separately via parse-list roundtrip tests.

## D20 — KnownBugs keyed on solution_name (intended behavior change)

**ADR:** [`adr/0002-knownbugs-key-on-solution-name.md`](adr/0002-knownbugs-key-on-solution-name.md)

**Decision:** `TensileLogic.KnownBugs` now keys documented `--check-all` skips on
`(path, solution_name)` (the solution's stable `SolutionNameMin`) instead of the
positional `(path, solution_index)`; `solution_index` support is dropped. The
`test_knownbugs_char.py` goldens for `test_is_known_bug_hit_and_miss` and
`test_load_roundtrip_multi` were re-recorded to match. This is an intended
behavior change (not a pinned bug): positional indices shift on re-tuning and
forced manual edits to `known_bugs.yaml`, whereas the content-derived name is
stable and self-invalidating. Motivating context: ROCM-7144.

**Note:** the two golden nodes were hand-edited to match syrupy's amber format
and must be confirmed byte-identical via `--snapshot-update` in a build
environment; the `-m unit` lane needs the compiled rocisa module, which is not
available where this change was authored.

## D21 — `test_bigfile_capped_emit` decoupled from live `library/src` tuning data

**ADR:** [`adr/0012-decouple-bigfile-tests-from-library-src.md`](adr/0012-decouple-bigfile-tests-from-library-src.md)

**Decision:** Replace the 10 `_BIG` entries' live `library/src` tuning-data references with vendored, trimmed, self-contained fixtures under `_codegen/data/bigfiles/`; add `test_no_library_src_dependency_char.py` as a standing AST-scan regression guard against the coupling reappearing.

## D22 — `test_bigfile_capped_emit` basename churn from upstream StreamK/GSU codegen changes

**Context:** After rebasing D21's fixtures onto current `develop`, 3 of the 10 `test_bigfile_capped_emit` cases (`equality_gfx950_HSS_big`, `gfx950_origami_MX`, `gfx1201_I8II`) failed on basename only — `err` stayed `0` and each fixture's solution count matched its `cap` exactly (6 solutions in, 6 emitted), so the affected kernels are unchanged in identity, just renamed. Root cause: `Tensile/Components/GSU.py`, `GlobalWriteBatch.py`, `StreamK.py`, and `KernelWriterAssembly.py` changed on `develop` (notably #9401 "enable PrefetchAcrossPersistent for SK4 and SK5" and #11245 "CompactLoopStore for D-store, MBSK, and StreamK") between when these fixtures were baselined and now, shifting the content-derived `MinNaming` hash for a subset of solutions that happen to hit those codegen paths. Same category as D16/D17.

**Decision:** Re-recorded only the 3 affected snapshot nodes via `--snapshot-update`; verified locally beforehand that both old and new basenames refer to the same 6 vendored solutions per fixture (no solution added/dropped/reordered-in-or-out of the capped set), and that assembly still emits cleanly (`err == 0`) for all of them.

## D23 — Canonical code-object linker input order

**ADR:** [`adr/0013-canonical-code-object-link-order.md`](adr/0013-canonical-code-object-link-order.md)

**Decision:** Sort every code object's input paths immediately before linking,
so default and explicitly grouped code objects share one deterministic physical
kernel order even though their inputs originate from different collection types.

## D24 — CustomKernels: re-target at `_readEmbeddedYaml` after Gemm-From-Anywhere removed `getCustomKernelConfigAndAssembly`

**ADR:** [`adr/0002-custom-kernels-embedded-yaml-parsing.md`](adr/0002-custom-kernels-embedded-yaml-parsing.md).

**Context:** `test_custom_kernels_char.py` (added on `develop` by #7989) pinned
`getCustomKernelConfigAndAssembly`, a raw `---`/`...` line-splitter returning
`(config_text, assembly_text)`. The Gemm-From-Anywhere branch's rewrite of
`CustomKernels.py` (proper `.amdgpu_metadata` YAML parsing for the external-
kernel `custom.config` schema) dropped that function in favor of a private
`_readEmbeddedYaml` returning a parsed dict — the two branches diverged before
#7989 merged to `develop`, so this was never reconciled. The stale import
caused a pytest **collection** error, which (per pytest's default behavior)
aborted the entire `-m unit` run before any test executed — silently hiding
every other test in the suite behind this one file, not just this module.

**Decision:** Point the test at the real replacement (`_readEmbeddedYaml`,
pinning its parsed-dict return) instead of restoring the removed function.
Also gave `test_get_custom_kernel_config_ok` its own fixture with a minimal
`amdhsa.kernels` entry (`_VALID_S_WITH_KERNEL_META`), matching the convention
in `Tests/unit/test_CustomKernelMetadata.py::write_kernel`, since
`getCustomKernelConfig`'s new no-explicit-`CustomKernel` auto-infer path
requires one (real kernel `.s` files always have one; only the bare-minimum
test fixture didn't).

**Why:** Same-purpose replacement (pin how the module reads its embedded
YAML), not a scope cut; add-only (no production code touched); private-helper
characterization already has precedent in this same branch
(`test_CustomKernelMetadata.py` imports `_parse_tensile_yaml`/`_read_asm_file`
directly).

**Rejected alternatives:**
- *Restore `getCustomKernelConfigAndAssembly`* — rejected per explicit
  direction: don't reintroduce what Gemm-From-Anywhere deliberately removed.
- *Delete the test instead of replacing it* — rejected: loses real coverage of
  the embedded-YAML parsing path with no offsetting gain.

**Validation:** `test_custom_kernels_char.py` — 11 passed, byte-identical
`.ambr` across two additional `--snapshot-update`-free re-runs.

**Residual scope (not fixed here):** unblocking collection let the full
`-m unit` suite actually run for the first time on this branch's diff, and it
surfaced 12 pre-existing failures unrelated to this file. Triaged and closed
in D24 below.

## D25 — Triage of the 12 failures D23 unblocked: 2 real regressions fixed, 10 stale-fixture goldens/asserts updated

**Context:** D23 fixed a pytest *collection* error that had aborted the entire
`-m unit` run before any test executed, on this branch's diff, since it
diverged from `develop`. With collection fixed, the suite ran for the first
time and surfaced 12 failures across 6 files, all in code this branch itself
touched. Each was triaged individually per the "did you intend to change this
behavior?" protocol in `README.md` — no blanket `--snapshot-update`, no
fixing-via-the-test of anything that was a real code bug.

**Two were real regressions; fixed the source, not the tests/goldens:**

- **`TensileLogic/HandleCustomKernel.hasCustomKernel`** — the line-scanner's
  marker pattern was changed from `CustomKernelName:` (legacy flat key) to
  `name:` (matching the new `CustomKernel:` mapping's nested name field), but
  `handleCustomKernel()` itself still explicitly accepts *either* shape
  (`sol["CustomKernel"]["name"]` or `sol.get("CustomKernelName", "")`). The
  narrowed scanner is reachable from a live gating call site
  (`TensileLogic/Run.py:105`, `if check.OnlyCustomKernels and
  hasCustomKernel(file): ...`) that decides whether a logic file's solutions
  get loaded at all under `--only-custom-kernels`-style checks — so a legacy
  `CustomKernelName:`-keyed logic file would have its custom-kernel solutions
  silently dropped from that check. Fixed by matching *both*
  `CustomKernelName:` and `CustomKernel:` (the distinctive parent keys for
  each schema — not the generic, collision-prone bare `name:`), restoring the
  original (unchanged) golden's expectation. Added
  `test_has_custom_kernel_true_new_style_mapping` since the new-style path had
  zero prior coverage.
- **`Toolchain.Component.Assembler._retargetAssemblySource`** — new,
  unconditional preprocessing step on every single assembly compile (rewrites
  a mismatched `.amdgcn_target`/`amdhsa.target` directive in the source to
  match the actual build target — the mechanism the `CustomKernels/README.md`
  Triton section describes). It called `path.read_text()` with no handling
  for a missing/unreadable file (only `UnicodeDecodeError` was caught), so any
  `srcPath` that doesn't exist yet crashes `Assembler.__call__` with a
  confusing traceback instead of reaching the actual compiler invocation
  right after, which would raise its own clear "no such file" error through
  the already-exercised `_invoke`/`CalledProcessError` path. Widened the catch
  to `(UnicodeDecodeError, OSError)`. Also added
  `test_retarget_assembly_source_rewrites_mismatched_target` and
  `..._leaves_matching_target_untouched` — the regex rewrite itself had zero
  test coverage anywhere in the repo before this.

**Everything else was a stale test double, not a code bug — production
behavior is correct; the fixtures just don't auto-default new fields the way
their real counterparts do:**

- **`ValidParameters::test_valid_parameters_{key_roster,structure}`** — clean,
  intentional, single-line-diff changes in `Common/ValidParameters.py`:
  `CustomKernelName` renamed to `CustomKernel` (matches the mapping-typed
  parameter everywhere else in this branch), and
  `AssertFree0/1ElementMultiple` / `AssertSummationElementMultiple` extended
  with `64`/`128`/`256` (larger custom-kernel tile sizes). Updated both
  goldens; reviewed the diff line-by-line (see the `.ambr` diff in the PR).
- **`TensileMain::test_arg_updated_global_parameters_*`** and
  **`PublicInputSurface::test_platform_*_branch_*`** — two independently
  hand-rolled fake-`args` builders (`_args()` / `_make_args()`, one using
  `SimpleNamespace`, one using `argparse.Namespace` directly) both predate the
  new `--validate-metadata` flag (`Tensile.py`'s `argUpdatedGlobalParameters`
  now reads `args.ValidateMetadata`). A *real* `argparse` parser always
  supplies a `store_true` flag's default (`False`), so this can't happen
  outside a test; added `ValidateMetadata=False` to both builders. Extended
  `TensileMain`'s "all overrides" test to actually cover
  `ValidateMetadata=True` (previously untested) and added a explicit
  default-omitted case; `PublicInputSurface`'s file is narrowly scoped to the
  unrelated `platform` predicate per its own docstring, so left it at the
  minimal fixture fix.
- **`TensileCreateLibraryRun::test_pass_post_kernel_info_to_solution`** — same
  shape of issue: `KernelCodeGenResult` gained a `customKernelDef:
  Optional[dict] = None` field (a real instance always has it via the
  `NamedTuple` default), but the test's `SimpleNamespace` stand-in doesn't
  auto-default missing attributes the way a `NamedTuple` does. Added
  `customKernelDef=None`/`=<a dict>` to the two cases and a new test,
  `..._carries_custom_kernel_def`, pinning the previously-uncovered
  `solution._state["CustomKernel"] = result.customKernelDef` assignment.

**Validation:** every touched file re-run individually (all green) plus two
full, `--snapshot-update`-free `-m unit` runs of the whole suite (see the PR
description for the exact before/after counts).

**Rejected alternatives:**
- *Blanket `--snapshot-update` across the whole suite* — forbidden by this
  file's own cardinal rule; would have silently accepted the two real
  regressions above instead of fixing them.
- *Leave `hasCustomKernel`/`_retargetAssemblySource` as-is and just fix the
  two tests* — rejected: both are reachable from real call sites, and
  "fixing" the test to assert the buggy behavior would have pinned a real
  regression as if it were intended, exactly what this suite exists to catch.

## D26 — LibraryIO characterization: add-only mutation-kill snapshot cases
**Decision:** The LibraryIO mutation-hardening slice pins additional *current*
LibraryIO behavior by appending new syrupy cases to three existing goldens
(`test_parse_integration_char.ambr`, `test_serializers_char.ambr`,
`test_writesolutions_char.ambr`); no existing snapshot value is re-recorded.
**Classification:** category (a) intended behavior capture -- new cases pinning
previously-unsnapshotted read/write/parse behavior to raise mutation kill power,
not a change to any pinned behavior. The diffs are insertion-only (+258/-0,
+9/-0, +54/-0) and confined to the LibraryIO node, so no ADR is required (nothing
behavior-changing or known-wrong is pinned); this registry line is the record.
The parse_integration additions begin in the mutation infra base and continue
in this slice.
**Re-run:** goldens byte-identical on two further no-update runs; `-m unit` green.

## D27 — Solution.py mutation kill: pickle-free `.ambr` derivation golden
**Decision:** Kill the `Solution.assignDerivedParameters` mutant giant with a
syrupy `.ambr` full-derived-state golden regenerated from in-tree designed YAML
configs, committing no pickle. See ADR 0003.
**Why:** the giant (~18820 mutants across the `depthU`/`adp` families) is only
observable by asserting the complete derived `_state`; a pickle golden is opaque,
version-coupled, and undiffable, against the suite's add-only diffable-golden
discipline. Unlike the LibraryIO add-only cases in D24, this introduces a new
golden *vehicle* with a non-obvious regeneration mechanism, so it lands with an
ADR (0003), not just this registry line.
**Equivalence evidence:** verified kill-equivalent to the interim pickle corpus
over 8 stratified windows (lines 1567-2857, 684 mutants, 0 per-key exit-code
divergence). Byte-stability confirmed by two further no-update runs.
**Harness fixes (not source):** derivation moved out of collection (a
collection-time try/except was swallowing raising mutants); `_sanitize` now
recurses into any `Mapping` so `ProblemType` is deep-compared, closing 4
`MirrorDimsMetadata` mutants a `str()`-only render missed.
**Regeneration:** on an intentional derivation/config change, rerun with
`--snapshot-update`, confirm byte-stability with two clean runs, and log the
regeneration here.

## D28 — Per-file ratchet audit after wave-2 (r8 + HUX crossover)
**Decision:** Keep the current `develop` floors for the six files flagged in
review, except for two reproducible increases: raise `Configuration.py` from
91.18% to 92.53% and `StreamK.py` from 82.18% to 82.24%. Do not import the
higher floors measured on `users/davidd-amd/mut-v2-coverage` at e69017042cf.

**Evidence:** The local combined report and the uploaded #11967 report agree to
two decimal places: Configuration 92.53%, segment_interleave 94.41%, Solution
70.40%, Component 93.49%, GSU 73.72%, and StreamK 82.24%. The gate passes all
172 files with the existing one-point tolerance. No floor is lowered;
Solution.py remains at 70.55% even though the current measurement is 0.15 points
lower.

The e69017042cf report was produced from a different source and test tree. That
tree has 101 test files absent from this layer, while this layer has 58 other
test files and 198 modified tests. Relative to that tree, segment_interleave,
Solution, GSU, and StreamK also changed substantially. The old 99.25%, 100.00%,
74.58%, 97.20%, 75.86%, and 84.29% values therefore cannot be used as floors for
this earlier stack layer.

**Classification:** None of the six reported drops is run-to-run measurement
noise; repeated local and hosted runs reproduce the current values. Configuration
and Component lost indirect execution supplied by the other test tree.
segment_interleave, Solution, GSU, and StreamK combine a different test set with
source growth. Restoring the old floors requires new tests rather than another
baseline reduction: cover ExpressionEvaluator and reverse-operator branches in
Configuration, asymmetric aligned layouts in segment_interleave, consolidated
derived-state cases in Solution, LDS token selection in Component, and focused
reduction/fixup paths in GSU and StreamK.

## D29 — Remove unstable set-cover basename snapshots

**ADR:** [`adr/0026-remove-setcover-basename-snapshots.md`](adr/0026-remove-setcover-basename-snapshots.md)

**Decision:** Remove the three basename-only set-cover saved-result files.
Keep the 75 selected configuration cases as bounded generation checks, capture
derivation rejection reasons, and use focused source patterns where final
assembly exposes a stable behavior. Superseded by D32, which defines exact
observables for the bounded sample.

## D30 — Select set-cover problem groups by complete content

**ADR:** [`adr/0024-select-problem-groups-by-content.md`](adr/0024-select-problem-groups-by-content.md)

**Decision:** Replace positional `BenchmarkProblems` indexes with fingerprints
of complete entries. Superseded by D31 because complete entries include runtime
problem sizes that do not affect solution generation.

## D31 — Select problem groups by solution-generation inputs

**ADR:** [`adr/0027-select-problem-groups-by-generation-inputs.md`](adr/0027-select-problem-groups-by-generation-inputs.md)

**Decision:** Fingerprint the problem type and generation parameters while
excluding `BenchmarkFinalParameters`. Use `list_config_fingerprints.py` to list
the selectors after an intentional generation-input change.

## D32 — Strengthen bounded set-cover observables

**ADR:** [`adr/0028-strengthen-bounded-set-cover-observables.md`](adr/0028-strengthen-bounded-set-cover-observables.md)

**Decision:** Record each selected group's complete fork-permutation count and
the exact emitter-status multiset for its bounded sample. Remove throwaway
warm-up emits because canonicalization already removes the known scheduler-state
difference.

## D33 — Correct the disabled TDMSplit characterization

**ADR:** [`adr/0015-correct-disabled-tdmsplit-test.md`](adr/0015-correct-disabled-tdmsplit-test.md)

**Decision:** Replace the unreachable TDMSplit emission and saved-result checks
with assertions that normal solution derivation returns no kernels and reports
`TDMSplit is currently disabled`. The test no longer claims coverage of emitter
code that product validation prevents it from reaching.

## D34 — Refresh S00-S07 emit results after develop changes

**ADR:** [`adr/0016-refresh-s00-s07-results-after-develop.md`](adr/0016-refresh-s00-s07-results-after-develop.md)

**Decision:** Re-record only the 20 failing S00-S07 saved-result nodes with an
in-tree `rocisa` build. Every node retains its kernel count and emitter return
codes; only the content-derived basenames change.

## D35 — Refresh S08-S11 emit results after develop changes

**ADR:** [`adr/0017-refresh-s08-s11-results-after-develop.md`](adr/0017-refresh-s08-s11-results-after-develop.md)

**Decision:** Re-record only the 11 failing S08-S11 saved-result nodes with an
in-tree `rocisa` build. Every node retains its kernel count and emitter return
codes; only the content-derived basenames change.

## D36 — Rebaseline coverage after the develop rebase

**ADR:** [`adr/0018-rebaseline-coverage-after-develop.md`](adr/0018-rebaseline-coverage-after-develop.md)

**Decision:** Regenerate the per-file baseline from the green post-rebase unit
run. The update raises 16 floors, adds 14 current files, removes two entries for
files deleted by develop, and explicitly lowers the nine reproducibly stale
floors listed in ADR 0018. The tolerance remains 1 percentage point. Superseded
by D40, which corrects the reduction count and file classification.

## D37 — Config-driven saved results include emitted assembly

**ADR:** [`adr/0019-pin-config-driven-assembly.md`](adr/0019-pin-config-driven-assembly.md)

**Decision:** Record a SHA-256 digest of the emitted opcode set next to each
config-driven kernel's name and return code. This makes a change in instruction
kinds observable while ignoring known register, label, count, and order
variation. Superseded by D41 after the digest proved compiler-sensitive in the
shared coverage lane.

## D38 — Reject zero-width MX local reads before code generation

**ADR:** [`adr/0020-reject-zero-width-mx-local-reads.md`](adr/0020-reject-zero-width-mx-local-reads.md)

**Decision:** Reject a WMMA_V3 in-memory-swizzled MX solution during derivation
when `MatrixInstK // MXBlock` is non-positive or an M-major local read is
narrower than one scale block. Remove three tests that counted code reached only
before the previous code-generation exception.

## D39 — Select config problem groups explicitly

**ADR:** [`adr/0021-select-config-problem-groups.md`](adr/0021-select-config-problem-groups.md)

**Decision:** Include a `BenchmarkProblems` index in every set-cover case and
pass it through the config-driven harness. This records which problem group is
measured when a shared YAML contains more than one group. Superseded by D42
because an index still changes meaning when a group is inserted or reordered.

## D40 — Correct and refresh the post-mutation coverage baseline

**ADR:** [`adr/0022-correct-coverage-rebaseline.md`](adr/0022-correct-coverage-rebaseline.md)

**Decision:** Correct ADR 0018's accounting from nine to ten original floor
reductions and document the omitted `Configuration.py` and `Solution.py`
changes. This proposed refresh was subsequently superseded by D43; none of its
floor reductions remain in the rebased branch.

## D41 — Separate code-generation smoke coverage from semantic assertions

**ADR:** [`adr/0023-separate-codegen-smoke-from-semantics.md`](adr/0023-separate-codegen-smoke-from-semantics.md)

**Decision:** Remove the compiler-sensitive opcode-set hash from shared saved
results and remove basename snapshots from the 75 set-cover cases and 29
S00-S11 designed smoke cases. These tests require successful generation except
where an existing emitter failure is allowed. Tests that claim a specific
emitted behavior use explicit source-pattern assertions; the S11a conversion
test still detects replacement of `v_cvt_f32_i32`, while cases without a stable
final-assembly observable remain explicitly labeled generation smoke tests.

## D42 — Select set-cover problem groups by content

**ADR:** [`adr/0024-select-problem-groups-by-content.md`](adr/0024-select-problem-groups-by-content.md)

**Decision:** Identify each selected `BenchmarkProblems` entry by a short
SHA-256 fingerprint of its complete normalized YAML value. The harness searches
for that fingerprint instead of assuming a list position, so inserting or
reordering another group cannot silently redirect a set-cover test.

## D43 — Verify the repaired coverage baseline

**ADR:** [`adr/0025-verify-repaired-coverage-baseline.md`](adr/0025-verify-repaired-coverage-baseline.md)

**Decision:** After reproducing ADR 0022's values with a green pre-rebase
`coverage-unit` run, rebase the complete stack and retain current `develop`'s
newer baseline through every conflict. The rebased run passed at 84.14%; use its
report to raise 38 per-file floors without lowering any, and raise the exact
whole-project floor from 75% to 82%.

## D44 — Canonical persistent execution policy in generated names and schemas

[ADR 0014](adr/0014-canonical-persistent-policy-names.md) records the intended
policy-field migration in generated names, derived solution state, parameter
registries, and serialized defaults. The scoped codegen updates preserve
fixture membership, kernel counts, and emission return codes. Explicit names
for prebuilt kernels remain part of the compatibility contract.

## D30 — DataParallel scheduling arguments

[ADR 0015](adr/0015-data-parallel-scheduling-arguments.md) supersedes ADR 0014's
retained six-word payload for generated DataParallel kernels. Generated DP uses
two scheduling words and a tile cursor; prebuilt version-zero layouts retain
their recorded argument contract. ABI, emitted-control-flow, and numerical
tests carry the evidence for this change.
