"""Hermetic unit tests for ``Tensile.TensileLogic.ValidCorpusConsistency``.

Everything here builds its own tiny corpus under ``tmp_path`` -- no dependency
on the real ``Logic/asm_full`` checkout, unlike ``test_PlaceholderMerge.py`` /
``test_GpuRevisionTarget.py``, whose corpus-backed copies of these same checks
are skipped when that directory is absent. This is new logic being pinned,
not existing behavior being characterized, so plain asserts are used rather
than snapshots.
