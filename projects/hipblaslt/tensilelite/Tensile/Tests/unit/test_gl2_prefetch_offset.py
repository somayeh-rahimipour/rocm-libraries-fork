# GL2-prefetch address verification test (gfx1250).
#
# Runs the *production* GL2 prefetch address computation
# (GL2PrefetchLoad.init / setIncrement / calculateStartAddr / incrementAddr)
# inside a real assembled kernel on a gfx1250 GPU. The prefetch
# (global_prefetch_b8, which returns no data) is replaced by exporting each
# computed address as a byte offset from the tensor base. The host then checks
# that, across all cooperative threads and all per-thread loads, the computed
# offsets tile the coalesced x perpendicular block exactly once in steps of
# GlobalPrefetchSize.
#
# Each config describes a problem and a list of tensors to prefetch. A single
# kernel computes the addresses for *all* of them in one round -- exactly like
# production gl2PrefetchCalcAddr (setIncrement then calculateStartAddr per
# tensor) -- so A, B, MXSA and MXSB are exercised together, catching
# register/sgpr aliasing across tensors.
#
# Coverage:
#   - data tensors A and B (non-MX), TLU and non-TLU layouts
#   - MX scale tensors MXSA / MXSB (mxUnit = MatrixInstK / MXBlock)
#   - FP8 (bpe=1) and FP4 (bpe=0.5) element sizes, including mixed A/B dtypes
#   - ClusterDim != [1,1]: gl2-prefetch is emitted whenever PrefetchGL2 is set,
#     but the cooperative fan-out only engages for a real cluster, so every config
#     runs a [cx, cy] grid (shapes vary, incl. [4,4]). Each
#     WG self-identifies via ttmp (gfx12 carries the workgroup id in ttmp, not
#     s2): wg_x -> WorkGroup0, wg_y -> WorkGroup1. A 2D cluster drives A and B
#     (and MXSA/MXSB) cooperatively at the same time. The *whole* cluster
#     cooperates: A is macro-tile-selected by WorkGroup0 and cooperative across
#     the rest of the cluster, B is the mirror, and together the cluster's
#     workgroups cover every macro-tile the cluster consumes (contiguous along
#     the MT-selector axis). Each WG writes to its own output region; the host
#     aggregates across all cx*cy.
#   - StridedBatched: a batch dim (index 2) maps to WorkGroup2, and
#     calculateStartAddr folds WorkGroup2 * Stride{tc}K into the base address.
#     Batched configs launch a 3D [cx, cy, num_batches * GSU groups] grid (wg_z from
#     ttmp7[31:16]); each batch b is verified against its footprint shifted by
#     b * Stride{tc}K * bpe.
#   - SupportUserArgs: under ArgType == 3 (general batch; bits 8+ carry a TDM wave
#     id the compare must mask) Address{A,B} is a pointer array and the base is
#     Address{tc}[WorkGroup2] + batchOffset{tc}. The entries are only used in
#     address arithmetic, never dereferenced, so each batch is checked against the
#     footprint shifted by its own entry + batchOffset{tc}, chosen to carry into
#     the high word. K == 0 skips the dereference; MX scales keep the strided
#     base. Under GSU the chunk offset must land on top of the resolved base,
#     so pointer-array configs also run with GSU.
#   - Address increment (PGL=2): the start address skips the PGR iterations the
#     regular loads already fetched via skipPGR, guarded like production by
#     LoopCounterL > PGR (with fewer iterations there is nothing to prefetch, so
#     the skip must not run). Each prefetched-ahead iteration then advances every
#     address by `inc` (incrementAddr). The kernel re-exports all addresses across
#     n_inc+1 stages; stage s must be the base footprint shifted by (skip+s)*inc
#     along the summation (K) axis, where skip is PGR if the guard passes else 0.
#     PGR 0, 1 (the carry-add path) and >1 (the 64-bit multiply path) are covered.
#   - GlobalSplitU: each workgroup prefetches only its own slice of K, so
#     calculateGSUIterOffset/applyGSUChunk shift the start address by
#     startIter*inc and widen the per-iteration step to the chunk stride. Both
#     chunk layouts are covered: interleaved (GSUC=0, group g starts at
#     iteration g and steps G at a time) and contiguous (GSUC=1, group g starts
#     after every lower group's run and steps one at a time, with the first
#     numIter%G groups getting an extra iteration). Each group is verified
#     against its *own* chunk rather than aggregated, so a group landing on the
#     wrong K slice fails. The group index is fed from the grid z axis rather
#     than split out of workgroup y as production does; see build_kernel. Both
#     workgroup mappings are covered: ClusterDim [1,1] for the default mapping,
#     where a cluster's workgroups cannot share a group, and GSU x cluster for
#     GSUWGMRR=1, where they can; see the GSU block in CONFIGS.
#   - Non-power-of-2 MacroTile (e.g. 384 for A/B, 192/96 for MX scales): exercises
#     MT offset, non-POT gl2ncc (vectorStaticDivideAndRemainder), and non-POT
#     perpendicular/coalesced extents. DepthU remains a multiple of MatrixInstK.
# Verification is set-based: the union of each tensor's computed byte offsets
# (per stage) must equal the cluster's contiguous prefetch footprint
# {perp*perp_stride + c*GPS} (the mt_tiles macro-tiles the cluster spans folded
# into one block), shifted by the stage's K increment. The cluster's workgroups
# jointly enumerate this footprint (the host aggregates across all cx*cy). It
# tolerates the benign replication of the whole-cluster scheme (overlapping
# cooperative-thread slices, and nc < cooperative threads, e.g. MX scales).
# That footprint mirrors the implementation's chunk count, so a second check
# is derived from the tile alone: every valid byte of every tile row must fall
# inside some [offset, offset + GlobalPrefetchSize) window. An undercounted
# gl2ncc that leaves a row tail unprefetched fails there even if the footprint
# model undercounts the same way.
#
# test_gl2_prefetch_codegen runs without a device: it only generates and
# assembles each config's kernel, so CPU-only runners (including the coverage
# lane) still exercise GL2Prefetch's codegen paths.
#
# Usage:
#   pytest test_gl2_prefetch_offset.py -v -s
#   python test_gl2_prefetch_offset.py --debug

    """Build a kernel computing GL2 addresses for all of cfg.tensors at once.

    The kernel emits cfg.n_inc+1 "stages": stage 0 is the start address after
    the loop-counter-guarded skipPGR, and each later stage calls incrementAddr
    once more, so stage s is shifted by (cfg.skip_iters + s) * inc from the base
    footprint. This exercises both addr-increment paths (skipPGR and the
    per-iteration incrementAddr).

    Returns (asm, layout, n_out) where layout is a list of
    (TensorSpec, num_loads, stage, region_start) describing the output partition.

    `stage` shifts the whole footprint along the K axis: stage 0 is the start
    address (skipPGR already advanced it by PGR increments unless the
    loop-counter guard branched over it), and each later stage adds one
    incrementAddr. The shift is orthogonal to the free-dim edge clamp, so it
    just translates the set.

    `group` is the GSU group, which shifts the footprint onto that group's K
    chunk. Both the chunk start and the stage stride are whole multiples of the
    one-DepthU increment, so the K shift is
        (startIter(group) + (skip + stage) * iterStride) * inc
    with GSU off collapsing to the plain (skip + stage) * inc.

    `batch` adds the StridedBatched shift batch * Stride{tc}K * bpe (the
    WorkGroup2 * batchStride term calculateStartAddr folds into the base
    address); like the stage shift it is a pure translation of the set.
    The whole cluster cooperates, so the footprint spans all mt_tiles macro-tiles
    the cluster consumes as one contiguous block (folded into tensor_dims): ncc
    coalesced GPS-chunks x `perp` perpendicular rows, with the edge-limit clamp
    min(index, SizeFree-1) applied to the coalesced index (TLU/MX) or the
    perpendicular index (non-TLU).

    We deliberately do NOT model the thread<->address mapping (cooperative-WG
    fan-out, inactive-bit shifts, per-thread load counts): those are an
