"""Behavioral tests for KernelWriterAssembly.disableWmmaArbStall.

DISABLE_XDL_ARB_STALL lives in SCHED_MODE (hwreg 26) at a bit position each arch
declares for itself. The declaration is a one-row-per-arch table (stinkytofu
HwReg::schedModeDisableXdlArbStall, mirrored into rocisa's
archCaps["WmmaArbStallBitOffset"]) and the emitter holds no constant of its own
-- it used to hardcode 4, which is wrong for gfx1250.

Nothing below is arch-specific: the archs under test and their expected bits are
DECLARED_BITS, and an arch whose toolchain is unavailable skips. A new arch adds
a row there and needs no new test.

Companion to test_arch_steppings.py's
test_wmma_arb_stall_bit_offset_is_declared_per_arch, which pins the declared
value in the capability map. This file pins what the emitter does with it.
