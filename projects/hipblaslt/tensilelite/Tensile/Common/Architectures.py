    What steppings changed is not the order but what survives the answer: the
    name used to be rebuilt from its ISA, and gfx1250-strict shares (12,5,0)
    with gfx1250, so the rebuild silently reported the wrong stepping.

    The enumerator's answer goes through ``restore_steppings`` because asking it
    first is not free: as of ROCm 10.2 amdgpu-arch -- the default enumerator --
    names an A0 gfx1250 part "gfx1250", so the enumerator always answered and
    the ``detect_gpu_archs`` fallback never ran. Configs that name no ISA get
    their target from here, so a strict part built and tuned as base, and the
    only sign was the arch in the artifact path.
