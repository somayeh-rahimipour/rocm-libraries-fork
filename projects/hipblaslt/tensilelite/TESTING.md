## Unit Testing Strategy

**Purpose.** Validate logic that can be exercised without dispatching a kernel to a physical device:
kernel and solution selection, code generation, and the library logic data that drives them. This is
where most of hipBLASLt's hardware-independent testing lives overall — see
[../TESTING.md#unit-testing-strategy](../TESTING.md#unit-testing-strategy) for how this compares to
the C++ client's much thinner unit-test story.

The code generator is pure Python producing text, so essentially all of it is testable with no GPU.
How much of that testing is *unit* testing, as opposed to characterization scaffolding, is a separate
question that this section returns to below. It matters more than the headline coverage number does.

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | pytest, orchestrated by `tox` |
| Location | [`Tensile/Tests/unit/`](Tensile/Tests/unit/) |
| Golden snapshots | [syrupy](https://github.com/syrupy-project/syrupy), `.ambr` files in per-module `__snapshots__/` directories |
| How to run | `cd tensilelite && tox -e unit` (skips the client build), or `tox -e rocisa` for the extension only |
| Coverage | `tox -e coverage-unit` measures; `tox -e coverage-gate` enforces the floors against what it wrote |

A significant part of that suite is a **characterization suite** under
[`Tensile/Tests/unit/characterization/`](Tensile/Tests/unit/characterization/), established in
[PR #7989](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/7989) and grown considerably since. It now
spans dozens of characterized module directories, each backed by one or more `.ambr` golden files
in its own `__snapshots__/` directory, plus a separate codegen harness that characterizes generated
assembly per architecture. These
are explicitly *not* specification tests: they pin down what the code does today, including latent
bugs, so that the ongoing consolidation refactor shows any unintended behavior change as a reviewable
diff rather than a silent downstream regression. Latent bugs found while characterizing are flagged in
that directory's `DECISIONS.md` rather than silently fixed, so a golden that encodes wrong behavior is
documented as such.

**Characterization coverage is not unit coverage, and the coverage numbers do not distinguish them.**
This is the most important caveat on every percentage in this document. A characterization golden
proves that behavior did not change. It does not prove the behavior is correct, and by design some
goldens pin behavior that is known to be wrong. A unit test asserts what the code *should* do. So a
line reached only by a characterization test is protected against accidental change but unverified,
and it still owes a real test.

How that migration gets measured, and why no enforced number can see it, is covered under
[Coverage](#coverage).

The discipline that goes with goldens is documented in the suite's
[README.md](Tensile/Tests/unit/characterization/README.md) and is worth stating here because it is
easy to get wrong: **never run a blanket `pytest --snapshot-update`.** It rewrites every golden at
once and produces a green run that proves nothing. Update the smallest node id you intend to change,
read the resulting diff, and explain the behavior change in your PR description.

**The goldens are enforced, and they do gate a merge.** Which lanes assert them, and the one lane
that skips them, is covered under
[Where these tests actually run](#where-these-tests-actually-run).

The suite also carries two enforced coverage floors: a whole-project floor and a per-file ratchet
with a one percentage point tolerance, so per-file coverage can only move up over time. Both are
enforced in CI (see [Coverage](#coverage)).

A GPU-less seam, the `--cpu-only` switch, lets the client and device-probe paths of the benchmark
flow be exercised without hardware, via an architecture spoof and a client-launch stub. Its
performance output is synthetic and fixed, so it is useful for testing the plumbing and useless for
anything performance-related. The switch is covered by
[`Tensile/Tests/unit/test_cpu_only_switch.py`](Tensile/Tests/unit/test_cpu_only_switch.py) and
documented, with that caveat, at
[`_codegen/GPU-MOCK.md`](Tensile/Tests/unit/characterization/_codegen/GPU-MOCK.md).

**Mutation testing** is how the scaffolding earns its keep. Coverage only says a line was executed;
a surviving mutant says the suite did not notice when that line's behavior changed, which is exactly
the failure mode a golden-based suite is prone to. It is the only signal available today that
distinguishes a characterization test that would catch a regression from one that merely runs the
code, so widening it is what makes the scaffolding trustworthy while the unit tests are still being
written.

Today it is a report-only pilot on an eight-file slice, run through `tox -e mutation-unit` and
configured in `pyproject.toml`. It started at five files in
[PR #7989](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/7989) and grew by three in
[PR #9337](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/9337).
It is not a gate and does not run in CI. Accepted equivalent mutants
and every `# pragma: no mutate` are justified in `DECISIONS.md`. A series of PRs widening the
mutation-hardened surface starts at
[PR #10133](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/10133); those are still in draft.

**Suite size.** The characterization half and the pure-unit half are roughly comparable in size, and
together they run into the thousands of tests; a small minority are GPU-guarded and skip on a
CPU-only runner. All of them run in four separate CI lanes (see
[Where these tests actually run](#where-these-tests-actually-run)).

**Coverage expectation.** The enforced whole-project floor is `fail_under = 75` in
[`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml), which is deliberately the only place that number lives. The
comment beside it records the intent: 80% is the target, and the floor is set below the measured
value on purpose so that ordinary run-to-run noise cannot trip an exact cutoff. Recent runs measure
78.55% on the GitHub Actions lane and 78.68% in Math CI, which is close enough agreement to trust.
Per-file floors ratchet separately.

Read that number with the caveat above firmly in mind: it is union coverage across the unit and
characterization suites, so it describes how much code is *protected*, not how much is *verified*.
There is no enforced target on the unit-only share, which is the number that actually tracks the
migration. See [Coverage](#coverage) for the full breakdown.

### Logic-corpus consistency regression tests

A third category sits outside the unit/characterization split: checks that validate the *entire
production logic YAML corpus* for cross-file naming and metadata invariants, rather than exercising a
fixture or pinning current behavior. In spirit this is closer to
[`TensileLogic --check-all`](#build-time-validation-of-library-logic) than to a unit test: both
validate tuning data rather than code, and where each one lives follows from that.

Two of these checks — sibling-`DeviceNames` consistency and the gfx1250v0-overlay's logic-tree shape —
are implemented in `Tensile.TensileLogic.ValidCorpusConsistency` and run unconditionally inside
`TensileLogic --check-all`, so every kernel-generating build checks them regardless of which test lane
executes; see [Build-Time Validation of Library Logic](#build-time-validation-of-library-logic). A
corpus-backed pytest copy of each also lives in
[`test_PlaceholderMerge.py`](Tensile/Tests/unit/test_PlaceholderMerge.py) and
[`test_GpuRevisionTarget.py`](Tensile/Tests/unit/test_GpuRevisionTarget.py) respectively — redundant
confirmation wherever the real corpus happens to be on disk, not the enforcement point.

The chip-ID-aware-arch lock, confirming that only gfx950 carries chip-ID-aware dispatch predicates,
stays a pytest-only check against the real corpus in `test_PlaceholderMerge.py`. Its single test scans
every architecture in the corpus to assert a whole-corpus fact, and wiring it into the build-scoped
`--check-all` invocation instead would let a single-arch build silently check only its own target
architecture — exactly the guarantee this check exists to provide. `test_PlaceholderMerge.py`'s
remaining three tests, an AST scan of `SolutionLibrary.py` plus two function-level unit tests, validate
code rather than data.

All of the above, including the corpus-backed pytest copies, are gated on whether the raw corpus
(`library/src/amd_detail/rocblaslt/src/Tensile/Logic/asm_full`, relative to the hipBLASLt root) happens
to be present, which it is not everywhere these tests run (see
[Known Bugs and Expected Failures](../TESTING.md#known-bugs-and-expected-failures) in the hipBLASLt
doc, and [CI visibility and gating](#ci-visibility-and-gating) below). A separate hermetic suite,
[`test_valid_corpus_consistency.py`](Tensile/Tests/unit/test_valid_corpus_consistency.py), tests the
`ValidCorpusConsistency` checker itself against synthetic fixtures and does not depend on that gate.

## rocisa

`rocisa` is the Python/C++ extension backing TensileLite's instruction generation. It lives at
[`rocisa/`](rocisa/), inside TensileLite rather than as a separate Math CI project — there is no
dedicated CODEOWNERS team or monorepo CI "project" entry for it, so it is documented here rather than
split out further.

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Run it | `cd tensilelite && tox -e rocisa` |
| Location | [`rocisa/test/`](rocisa/test/) |
| Framework | pytest |

**StinkyTofu coupling.** `_rocisa`'s native extension links directly against `stinkytofu::stinkytofu`
(see [`rocisa/CMakeLists.txt`](rocisa/CMakeLists.txt)), and the rocisa↔StinkyTofu conversion glue
(`AllHwMappings.cpp`, `ToStinkyTofuUtils.cpp`) is compiled straight into `_rocisa` rather than into
StinkyTofu's own library. This is a deep build-time coupling, not an incidental one, and Math CI's
own trigger config reflects it: hipBLASLt's `additionalIncludedRegions` lists `shared/stinkytofu/**`
(along with `shared/rocroller/**`, `shared/mxdatagenerator/**`, and `shared/origami/**`), so a
StinkyTofu-only change (nothing under `projects/hipblaslt/**` touched) still retriggers hipBLASLt's
own `precheckin` and `preliminary`. StinkyTofu and Origami are also the two names `preliminary`'s own
diff check looks for internally, so its tests actually run rather than no-op; rocRoller and
mxdatagenerator retrigger the pipeline the same way but are absent from that internal check, so
`preliminary` no-ops on those two unless the same PR also touches tensilelite, StinkyTofu, or Origami
(see [Dependencies and Validation Handoffs](../TESTING.md#dependencies-and-validation-handoffs) in the
hipBLASLt doc for the full comparison). StinkyTofu is still a separately owned, separately gated
component (`@ROCm/stinkytofu-reviewers`), so its own dedicated suite runs in its own CI project
independent of this; the two runs are not linked to each other.

**Component CI: rocISA**, despite the name, does not run these tests: it only tests a `pip install`
of the rocisa package. See [Where these tests actually run](#where-these-tests-actually-run).

## Build-Time Validation of Library Logic

**What it does.** `TensileLogic --check-all` validates the library logic YAML before any of it is
compiled. It checks chip IDs, matrix instructions, work-group shapes, the XCC work-group mapping, and
custom kernel declarations, one file at a time. It reads YAML only, so it needs no GPU and no compiled
kernels, and it is fast. A failure stops the build. It is the only mechanism in the component that
validates tuning data rather than code, it does not look or report like a test, and it exists because
of one specific incident.

### Why it runs in the build

Relative to the build, the logic YAML is compiler input rather than build output:
`TensileCreateLibrary` consumes it and emits kernels from it. Validating it is front-end analysis
rather than testing, and running codegen over input already known to be invalid produces output nobody
should trust. So the check is wired in as a CMake custom command in
[`HipBLASLtCodegen.cmake`](../cmake/HipBLASLtCodegen.cmake) that runs ahead of
`TensileCreateLibrary` and writes a stamp file. A failure stops the build.

That placement buys good reach. It runs on every build that generates kernels, including every
developer's local one, so a bad entry surfaces in the edit-build loop instead of a CI round trip
later. It cannot be skipped by a path filter and it cannot be dropped by a gating rule, neither of
which is true of the gating `preliminary` job.

That reach used to extend past the build's own target architectures. From when this gate was wired
into the build ([PR #5039](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/5039), 2026-05-05) until
2026-08-13, the build-wired invocation validated every logic file in the corpus regardless of which
`GPU_TARGETS` were being compiled, so a developer building only gfx1151 would still notice a broken
gfx942 entry.
[PR #9218](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/9218) (merged 2026-08-13) removed that:
whole-corpus validation was dominating incremental build time on single-arch builds (roughly ten
minutes locally for a gfx1151 build, validating the full multi-arch logic set when only a few dozen
files were relevant), so the CMake step now passes `--architecture "${GPU_TARGETS}"` to
`TensileLogic`, and only logic files matching the build's own target architectures are checked.
`TensileLogic --check-all` still defaults to validating the whole
corpus when a developer runs it by hand with no `--architecture` argument; it is only the build-wired
invocation that is now scoped down. The trade was deliberate and reasonable for build time, but it is
worth naming plainly: a single-architecture CI build no longer catches a broken entry in an
architecture it does not target, which narrows this gate's reach to exactly the union of architectures
across whatever set of builds happen to run on a given pull request.

What the placement costs is visibility and strictness. There is no check name in the pull request, no
test report, and no way for CI to run it in isolation. It also cannot be tightened in place, because
`--strict-known-bugs` would fail local developer builds over a stale entry someone else owns, which is
not a reasonable thing to do to a person trying to build. Both costs point at the same answer, and
that answer is a second lane rather than a different home for this one.

Two of the three checks named in
[Logic-corpus consistency regression tests](#logic-corpus-consistency-regression-tests) — sibling-
`DeviceNames` consistency and the gfx1250v0-overlay shape — live here rather than in that section's
pytest tests, for exactly this reason: this gate cannot be skipped by a path filter or a `_needs_logic_dir`
gap, and those two checks need that reach. The chip-ID-arch-lock check is the one that stays
pytest-only, since it asserts a whole-corpus fact (only gfx950 carries chip-ID-aware predicates) that a
per-architecture, per-build invocation would silently narrow.

### What it found once it existed

The first thing a new gate does is argue with itself, and this one was no exception. Pointed at the
full library it reported `Total 552358 solutions / Keep 552345 / Reject 13`. Thirteen gfx950 solutions
failing matrix instruction validation, quarantined rather than fixed and still open under ROCM-7144.
Shortly after, it failed a TheRock CI build on a gfx942 fp8 configuration, and that one turned out to
be the validator's fault rather than the data's: its MFMA tables were missing the fnuz key variants
(ROCM-24036, fixed in the same PR that added the gate).

Since then it has been quiet, which is the outcome you want and the hardest one to take credit for. A
retuning that breaks a CU-variant library the way ROCM-2963 did now fails a build in seconds instead
of reaching a customer's model three months earlier in the story. There is no way to know how many
times that has already happened, because a build that fails on line one of a bad YAML file does not
generate a ticket, a meeting, or a revert. That absence is the whole return on the investment.

Its known-bug list, [`Tensile/TensileLogic/known_bugs.yaml`](Tensile/TensileLogic/known_bugs.yaml), is
the best-structured quarantine in the component (see
[Known Bugs and Expected Failures](../TESTING.md#known-bugs-and-expected-failures) in the hipBLASLt
doc). Entries are keyed on the logic file path plus the solution's `SolutionNameMin`, a
content-derived name adopted in [PR #9355](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/9355) so that
keys survive library re-tuning instead of drifting with a positional index, and each entry carries a
`ticket:` field. The checker re-validates every entry and reports the ones that no longer reproduce, so
a fixed bug is detected rather than skipped forever. All 14 current entries document the same gfx950
validation drift.

`--strict-known-bugs` turns that detection into a failure, but it defaults off and nothing passes it
today, so a stale entry only warns. Enforcing it is tracked in AIHPBLAS-4196, which proposes the
right fix: a dedicated GitHub Actions job running
[`run_tensile_logic_check.py`](../scripts/run_tensile_logic_check.py) with the flag, rather than
tightening the in-build command. That ticket also names a remaining hole, which is that an orphaned
entry whose `solution_name` resolves to nothing currently matches nothing and is silently ignored, so
strict mode is not yet a complete dead-entry detector. Extending the gate to cover derived-parameter
assignment is tracked in AIHPBLAS-3575.

## Pre-submit / CI Gates

TensileLite is exercised by both of hipBLASLt's CI systems (see
[Pre-submit / CI Gates](../TESTING.md#pre-submit--ci-gates) in the hipBLASLt doc for the two-system
overview). The Math CI job that matters most for TensileLite is **`preliminary`**, the functional gate
for TensileLite, which runs two stages on gfx12, gfx90a, gfx942, and gfx950.

As of the Aug-26 2026 `rocJenkins` reorder (`bc21df82`, AIHPBLAS-4431), the stage order is: first
`tox -e unit -- Tensile/Tests/unit`, which carries no marker filter and therefore runs the entire unit
tree, characterization included, on all four architectures. Then, *only if that stage passed*,
`tox -e py3 -- Tensile/Tests "-m common"`, the GEMM selection that genuinely needs hardware. (Before
that reorder, `common` ran first and `unit` was conditional on it; if you are reading an older mirror
of this document or a stale local copy, check which order applies before trusting either stage's
gating story.)

Three conditions narrow when any of this happens, and all three are easy to miss:

1. The job diffs the change against `develop` and skips entirely when nothing under
   `tensilelite/`, `shared/stinkytofu/`, or `shared/origami/` has changed. A pull request touching
   none of those passes it without running anything. Notably, `shared/rocroller/**` and
   `shared/mxdatagenerator/**` are *not* in this list, even though both are among the paths that
   retrigger hipBLASLt's Math CI pipeline in the first place (see
   [Dependencies and Validation Handoffs](../TESTING.md#dependencies-and-validation-handoffs) in the
   hipBLASLt doc); a rocRoller- or mxdatagenerator-only PR gets `preliminary` scheduled but the job
   finds no relevant diff and no-ops.
2. The `common` stage is conditional on the *target branch*. It runs only when the PR targets
   `develop` or one of the two `hipblaslt_common_cms_*` branches. Which tests gate your change
   depends on where you aimed it.
3. The gate itself can be dropped, on top of condition 1 above. Math CI's `statusGate` carries a rule
   that removes `preliminary` from hipBLASLt's *required* gating list whenever the same pull request
   also touches rocroller specifically (no equivalent rule exists for mxdatagenerator), so a
   rocroller-touching change loses this gate silently even if it also happened to touch tensilelite,
   stinkytofu, or origami and would otherwise have run for real.

**A short-circuit from this reorder has already had a real consequence.** Two days after the Aug-26
reorder landed, an unrelated gfx1250 unit-test failure caused the `unit` stage to fail first, so the
`common`/GEMM stage — the one that would have directly exercised a StreamK register-pool regression
(the bug behind [#11335](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/11335), fixed in
[#11471](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/11471)) — never ran at all. Under the pre-Aug-26
order, `common` ran unconditionally and would have caught it directly. See the corresponding row under
[Known Risks and Gaps](#known-risks-and-gaps) below.

**`Tests/common` (real codegen, build, and execution against a CPU reference) does not run in TheRock
CI or GitHub Actions today, for any architecture.** It is easy to read the codebase as though gfx1250
were an exception that runs `Tests/common` under GPU emulation while other architectures skip it, but
that emulation branch in TheRock's `test_tensilelite.py` is unreachable code as of this writing: per
TheRock's `amdgpu_family_matrix.py` (the live family matrix actually imported by TheRock's CI-matrix
generation; a `new_amdgpu_family_matrix.py` also exists in that tree with the same fact under a
different field name, `run_tests: False` / `runs_on: {}`, but is not yet wired into anything), the
`gfx125x` family has an empty `test-runs-on` for Linux, with a `# No hardware available for testing
yet; build-only.` comment, so the entire Test stage — not just the unit tree — is skipped for that
family. This was confirmed live on PR #11447's own checks (`Test (gfx125X-dcgpu) / Configure test
matrix` skipping). So today, `Tests/common` coverage is Math-CI-only, on real hardware
(`gfx90a`/`gfx942`/`gfx950`/`gfx12`), and does not run anywhere in the public TheRock/GHA lanes,
gfx1250 included. See the corresponding roadmap item below, which tracks wiring it in for real
hardware.

Other Math CI jobs post checks without gating. The one worth knowing is
`tensilelite-unit-codecov`, which runs the TensileLite Python and C++ coverage environments on gfx950
and uploads to codecov under the `TensileLite-Unit` and `TensileLite-CPP` flags. It is two jobs in
one, a Python coverage run and a C++ coverage run sharing a single script, which is why it needs
gfx950 and why it takes hours rather than minutes. It reports a check, but that check is not
required, and a failure anywhere in it skips the codecov uploads, so a codecov number can be older
than the commit you are looking at.

### How Multi-Arch CI decides whether TensileLite runs at all

The three narrowing conditions above are specific to Math CI's `preliminary`. TheRock/GitHub Actions'
side has its own, separate selection step: rocm-libraries' Multi-Arch CI workflow
(`therock-multi-arch-ci.yml`) passes every changed path, including the monorepo's five `shared/*`
subtrees, straight into TheRock's own native selector
(`test_tools/determine_rocm_test_dependencies.py`), the same one every `projects/*` path uses
([PR #11901](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/11901)).

Two things make TensileLite specifically visible to that selector:

- **`projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite` has its own identity in change detection**, registered as a
  nested subtree distinct from `projects/hipblaslt` ([PR #11785](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/11785)),
  so a TensileLite-only change is distinguishable from a hipBLASLt-proper one.
- **TensileLite has a node in TheRock's consumer graph**, even though it has no CMake target of its
  own for `test_tools/therock_consumer_graph.json` to walk. TheRock's `test_policies.toml` declares it
  as a `[synthetic.tensilelite]` subproject with `hipblaslt` and `hipsparselt` as its consumers at an
  unbounded walk level, so a TensileLite change retests both and everything downstream of them exactly
  as if TensileLite were a real graph node (ROCm/TheRock#7998, ROCm/TheRock#7999).

The other `shared/*` paths reach TensileLite only by way of a dependency rather than a direct edit.
Their current selection outcome, verified against the pinned TheRock commit:

| Changed path | Selects the `tensilelite` job? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shared/origami`, `shared/stinkytofu`, `shared/mxdatagenerator` | Yes | |
| `shared/rocroller` | **No** | See below |
| `shared/tensile` | No — correctly | Not TensileLite. See below |

**`shared/tensile` is not TensileLite.** It is the legacy standalone `ROCm/Tensile` repository,
subtree-synced at `shared/tensile` and consumed only by rocBLAS's own kernel generator; nothing under
`projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite` depends on it. Worth stating plainly here given how easy the two names
are to conflate — a change there has no reason to retest hipBLASLt or TensileLite, and the selector
does not.

**A `shared/rocroller`-only change does not run TensileLite's own suite in Multi-Arch CI.** The
selector does resolve it to `hipblaslt` (among others), so hipBLASLt's own C++ client suite exercises
rocRoller-backed kernel dispatch at runtime. But it does not resolve to `tensilelite`: rocRoller has no
declared edge onto TensileLite's synthetic consumer-graph node, and
[`projects/hipblaslt/CMakeLists.txt`](../CMakeLists.txt) confirms why — rocRoller is a separate C++
kernel source linked directly into hipBLASLt (`HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_ROCROLLER`), not a dependency of
TensileLite's Python code generator. That is very likely the architecturally correct answer, but it
means TensileLite's own Python unit/characterization suite has no coverage at all for a rocRoller-only
change; see the corrected rows in Known Risks and Gaps below.

### Where these tests actually run

The TensileLite Python tree under `Tensile/Tests/unit` (characterization *and* unit, about six
thousand tests) executes in four separate CI lanes. They are easy to confuse with each other, and
with three adjacent lanes that sound like them but run none of these tests, so the whole set is worth
laying out once.

| Lane | Where defined | Hardware | Gates? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Component CI: TensileLite coverage` | [`component-ci-tensilelite-coverage.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/component-ci-tensilelite-coverage.yml) | CPU only | No. Rolls up to `Component CI Summary`, which is not required |
| `preliminary` | Math CI (internal) | gfx12, gfx90a, gfx942, gfx950 | **Yes**, via the required `Math CI Summary` |
| TheRock `Test tensilelite` | [`test_tensilelite.py`](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/build_tools/github_actions/test_executable_scripts/test_tensilelite.py) in TheRock | GPU runner, Linux | **Yes**, via the required `TheRock CI Summary` |
| `tensilelite-unit-codecov` | Math CI (internal) | gfx950 | No |

Three observations follow from that table, and they are the ones that most often get stated
backwards in review:

**The tests gate; the coverage numbers do not.** Both required checks (`Math CI Summary` through
`preliminary`, and `TheRock CI Summary` through the TensileLite job) execute the unit and
characterization suites, so a broken test blocks a merge. Neither of them looks at coverage. The
floor and the per-file ratchet are enforced only in lanes that cannot block anything. "None of it
gates" is wrong, and so is treating a coverage regression as a merge blocker.

**Three of the four lanes hold a GPU, and only one of them needs it for these tests.** TheRock's lane
is validating a real install, so its GPU is the point. `preliminary` needs hardware for its
`-m common` GEMM stage and the unit tests share the node because they run in the same job.
`tensilelite-unit-codecov` needs gfx950 for its C++ half only; the Python coverage run is along for
the ride, which is most of why that job takes about two and a half hours where the CPU-only GitHub
Actions lane takes seven minutes.

**Every one of these lanes is fail-fast, and that erases signal.** In each case one stage runs first
and everything after it is conditional on it passing: the two coverage lanes through the ordering of
tox `commands`, `preliminary` through an explicit exit-code guard between its two stages (see
[Pre-submit / CI Gates](#pre-submit--ci-gates) above for which stage now runs first), TheRock's
through plain sequential ordering. One early failure means you get no information at all from the
stages behind it, which is why a red run so often says less than it appears to.

**The goldens are asserted in three of the four lanes,** because every tox environment involved
inherits syrupy from the base `[testenv]` dependency list. `preliminary` is the one that matters,
because it gates: its unit-tree stage runs with no marker filter, so a stale golden fails a required
check. The two coverage lanes assert them as well and cannot block a merge, though the CPU-only
GitHub Actions lane is fast enough that it is usually where a stale golden surfaces first.

TheRock's installed-artifact lane is the exception. It does not install syrupy, so the suite's
`conftest.py` detects the missing plugin and skips the snapshot-using tests cleanly rather than
erroring the whole run. The tests are still collected, which is why that lane's log reads as though
characterization ran. Nothing is lost, because those goldens were asserted in the source lanes before
the artifact was built, but a reader scanning that run will see skips and should know they are
deliberate.

Three adjacent lanes run none of these tests, despite their names:
`Component CI: rocISA` only tests a `pip install` of the rocisa package; Math CI's `codecov` job is
C++ hipBLASLt coverage and is one character away from `tensilelite-unit-codecov`; and `precheckin` is
hipBLASLt's own client-suite job, unrelated to any of this despite building TensileLite as a
dependency.

## Coverage

Code coverage (how much code the tests execute) and test coverage (how much of the intended
functionality and scenarios are tested) are different things, and TensileLite is a good illustration
of the difference: it could reach high line coverage while leaving whole categories of
kernel-generation behavior unexercised.

TensileLite has a third distinction on top of those two, and it is the one most likely to mislead: a
covered line may be covered by a *unit test* that asserts intended behavior or by a *characterization
golden* that merely pins current behavior, bugs included. Every enforced number here is the union of
the two and cannot tell them apart. See [Unit Testing Strategy](#unit-testing-strategy) for why that
matters; the short version is that characterization coverage is scaffolding to be repaid, not testing
that is finished.

### The characterization-versus-unit split

The enforced floors cannot see that migration at all. Coverage is measured on the union of the two
suites, so converting a line from characterization protection to a genuine unit test leaves every
enforced number identical. A file can sit at 80% while almost all of that 80% is scaffolding, and no
gate will say a word.

What shows the migration is the split summary card, rendered into the GitHub Actions run summary
by the coverage lane. It splits every measurable statement into four buckets that sum to 100%:
reached by both suites, by characterization only, by unit only, and by no test at all. The
characterization-only count is the migration debt, and the goal is for it to fall toward zero.

The card also ranks the largest files by statement count with each file's unit-suite and
characterization-suite percentages side by side, which is how the next refactor target gets picked: a
high characterization percentage next to a low unit percentage is a file still leaning on scaffolding.
The two suites are kept disjoint in the coverage lane specifically so this attribution means
something.

Worth being blunt about the consequence. The one number that measures real progress is the one number
nothing enforces. Reading a file's coverage without reading its split is how a team convinces itself
it is further along than it is.

### What is measured today

| Scope | Tool | Measured in | Enforced |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TensileLite Python, unit and characterization combined | `coverage.py` via `tox -e coverage-unit` | GitHub Actions, on any change under `tensilelite/**`; Math CI measures it again for codecov | Floor plus per-file ratchet, 1 pp tolerance. Enforced in a lane that is not a required check |
| TensileLite Python, unit-only share | Same lane, reported in the split summary card | GitHub Actions | **No.** Informational only, and it is the number that tracks real progress |
| TensileLite Python, mutation score | `tox -e mutation-unit` | Nowhere; run by hand | No. Report-only pilot on eight files |
| TensileLite C++ host library | `tox -e coverage-cpp` | Math CI | Reported to codecov, not enforced |

The GitHub Actions coverage lane is CPU-only and takes roughly seven minutes. It runs the
characterization suite and the pure unit suite once each under coverage, keeping the two selections
disjoint so each line can be attributed to one or both, unions the results, and renders the
non-gating split summary card. That lane is deliberately scoped and is expected to retire once the
characterization-to-unit conversion finishes, which makes the card's characterization-only count a
rough progress bar for the lane's own retirement.

### Measuring and enforcing are separate tox environments

This is worth knowing before you try to reproduce a coverage failure. `coverage-unit` runs the suites
and writes the reports, reporting with `--fail-under=0` so it never gates. `coverage-gate` reads those
artifacts and applies both floors. The GitHub Actions lane runs them as two named steps and owns the
floors; Math CI's `tensilelite-unit-codecov` runs only the first, so it cannot be failed by a gate it
does not own.

The practical benefit is local reproduction. `coverage-gate` sets `skip_install = true` and depends
only on `coverage[toml]`, so it builds no rocisa, needs no ROCm, and runs no tests. Run
`coverage-unit` once, then re-run `coverage-gate` as often as you like against the `coverage.json`
you already have. Chasing a floor failure costs seconds rather than another pass over the full test
suite.

### Targets

Two different mechanisms carry a number, and they are easy to confuse:

- The **enforced floor** is `fail_under = 75` in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml), checked on the
  combined characterization-plus-unit dataset, alongside the per-file floors in
  `coverage-baseline.json`. This is what actually fails a run.
- The **codecov target** is 80% project coverage per flag, set in the monorepo's
  [`../../../codecov.yml`](../../../codecov.yml) for `TensileLite-Unit` and `TensileLite-CPP` along
  with every other library. No patch-coverage target is configured. Codecov's report is advisory here
  because the job that uploads it is not a required check.

80% is the direction of travel for the enforced floor, and the ratchet is how it gets there.

Neither mechanism sets a target on the unit-only share, and neither one would notice if the
characterization-only count stopped falling. Both numbers can be fully satisfied by a codebase whose
Python is entirely pinned and barely verified. Setting an explicit target on the unit-only share, so
the migration has a gate and not just a dashboard, is on the [roadmap](#improvement-roadmap).

### Scope and exclusions

Coverage measurement is Python-focused, and measured on Linux only; Linux
and Windows are not tracked separately. The exclusions in
[`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) cover test, build and packaging paths
rather than product modules. The kernel writers are sometimes described as uncovered exceptions, but
they are not: `KernelWriter.py`, `KernelWriterAssembly.py` and `SolutionStructs/Solution.py` all
carry active per-file floors in the seventies. The genuinely uncovered modules are elsewhere,
including `ExperimentalLibrary.py` at zero and much of `Tensile/Components/`.

**No C++ coverage target exists** for the reasons given under
[../TESTING.md#unit-testing-strategy](../TESTING.md#unit-testing-strategy) (the C++ client's own
structural blockers). Setting one before the host-side code is linkable in isolation would produce a
number nobody could act on.

## Improvement Roadmap

Ordered by value per unit of effort, not by ambition. This list only covers TensileLite, rocisa, and
the library-logic build-time validation; hipBLASLt's C++ client and library roadmap items live in
[../TESTING.md#improvement-roadmap](../TESTING.md#improvement-roadmap).

### Near term, cheap and unblocking

1. **Make the installed-artifact lane's snapshot behavior deliberate.** Either ship syrupy with the
   installed test tree so the goldens are checked there too, or state in the lane that snapshot
   coverage is intentionally left to the source lanes. Today it is a silent skip that reads like an
   accident.
2. **Make the test suite resolve its own toolchain.** Characterization tests locate `amdclang++`
   through a bare `shutil.which`, so whether they pass depends on how the surrounding lane happened
   to order `PATH`. The same tests then behave differently in different lanes for reasons that have
   nothing to do with the code under test. Resolving the toolchain inside the tox environment removes
   a recurring source of false failures.
3. **Enforce `--strict-known-bugs` in its own lane** (AIHPBLAS-4196). The detection already exists;
   what is missing is a job that fails on a stale entry. A dedicated GitHub Actions job is the right
   home for it, because the flag cannot be turned on inside the build without failing local developer
   builds. Worth extending to orphaned entries, which are silently ignored today.
4. **Run the Python linter that already exists.** `tox -e lint` is configured and invoked by nothing.
5. **Wire `Tests/common` into TheRock's `test_tensilelite.py` for real-hardware families, not just
   the currently-unreachable `gfx1250` emulation path.** Config collection is already marker-based per
   architecture, so this is mostly (a) broadening the hardcoded `gfx1250` gate and `--gpu-targets`
   string, and (b) growing the 15-minute job timeout budget, which is sized for gfx1250's ~130 configs
   alone. This closes the "`Tests/common` runs on zero TheRock/GHA architectures" gap above and gives
   redundant, faster-feedback coverage for exactly the bug class the StreamK/#11335 near-miss
   (see [Pre-submit / CI Gates](#pre-submit--ci-gates)) exposed. This is a TheRock-repository change,
   in `test_tensilelite.py` and its family-matrix configuration, not something this document can
   implement directly.

### Medium term, the structural unlock

1. **Put a number on the characterization-to-unit migration.** The split summary card already computes
   the characterization-only statement count. Track it over time and set a target on it, so the
   migration has a gate rather than a dashboard nobody is accountable for. Without this, the union
   floors are fully satisfiable by a codebase that is pinned everywhere and verified nowhere, and the
   scaffolding has no expiry date.
### Longer term, the real gap

1. **Graduate mutation testing** from a report-only pilot to a maintained signal on the modules where
   it has demonstrated value. This is the companion to the migration item above: until a module has
   real unit tests, its mutation score is the only evidence that its goldens would actually catch a
   regression rather than just execute the code.
2. **Type checking on TensileLite.** No type checking exists today despite type hints being a
   documented style rule. A large dynamically typed code generator with no type verification is a
   standing risk; see the related C++ static-analysis roadmap item in
   [../TESTING.md#improvement-roadmap](../TESTING.md#improvement-roadmap).

## Known Risks and Gaps

Stated plainly, so none of these are a surprise at release time. This section covers TensileLite,
rocisa, and library-logic validation; hipBLASLt's own C++/client gaps are in
[../TESTING.md#known-risks-and-gaps](../TESTING.md#known-risks-and-gaps). On the Tracking column, see
the note there: an empty cell means the gap is real and acknowledged but not yet tracked anywhere.

### Coverage and verification

| Gap | Regression risk | Impact | Mitigation today | Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enforced coverage counts characterization scaffolding as unit testing, overstating how much is verified | High | Medium | The split summary card reports the characterization-only share, but it gates nothing |  |
| Mutation testing, the only evidence a golden would catch a regression, covers eight files and runs nowhere in CI | Medium | Medium | Manual `tox -e mutation-unit`; widening PRs are in draft. Treated as report-only | AIHPBLAS-3868 |

### CI visibility and gating

| Gap | Regression risk | Impact | Mitigation today | Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `preliminary` no-ops on a mxdatagenerator-only change, since mxdatagenerator is absent from its own internal diff check | Medium | Medium | Multi-Arch CI's native selector resolves `shared/mxdatagenerator` to `tensilelite` among others, so the unit/characterization tree runs there — just without `preliminary`'s four-architecture GPU stage |  |
| `preliminary` is dropped from hipBLASLt's gating list whenever a PR also touches rocroller, and rocroller is also absent from `preliminary`'s own internal diff check, so a rocroller-only change gets no TensileLite functional testing from Math CI at all | High | High if hit | Multi-Arch CI's native selector selects hipBLASLt's own client suite for a rocroller-only change, exercising rocRoller-backed dispatch at runtime (see [How Multi-Arch CI decides whether TensileLite runs at all](#how-multi-arch-ci-decides-whether-tensilelite-runs-at-all)) — but it does not select the `tensilelite` job. TensileLite's own Python unit/characterization suite has no coverage for this path |  |
| The `preliminary` stage that runs the `common` GEMM suite is conditional on the target branch | Medium | Medium | Most pull requests target `develop` and do get the full gate |  |
| As of the Aug-26 2026 reorder, `unit` runs before `common` in `preliminary`, so an unrelated unit-test failure on one architecture prevents `common` from running at all that PR. This already let a StreamK register-pool bug ([#11335](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/11335), fixed in [#11471](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/11471)) merge with no `common`-stage signal, two days after the reorder landed | High | High if hit | None observed for this ordering specifically; the pre-reorder order ran `common` unconditionally | AIHPBLAS-4431 |
| `Tests/common` (real codegen, build, execution) does not run in TheRock CI or GitHub Actions for any architecture today, including gfx1250 (see [Pre-submit / CI Gates](#pre-submit--ci-gates)); coverage of that suite is Math-CI-only | Medium | High if hit | Math CI's `preliminary` runs it on real hardware, `gfx90a`/`gfx942`/`gfx950`/`gfx12` |  |
| The same TensileLite test suite runs in four lanes, three holding a GPU only one of them needs | Low | Low | Expensive in runner capacity; the redundancy does buy independent confirmation |  |
| The installed-artifact lane silently skips the snapshot tests, since syrupy is not in the installed tree | Low | Low | The goldens are enforced upstream; the skip is stated in `conftest.py` but reads like an accident |  |
| Math CI's `preliminary` job appears to skip the `Tensile/Tests/unit` suite entirely on YAML-only diffs, running only numeric/solution-correctness checks instead. Of the three logic-corpus consistency checks, this leaves only the chip-ID-arch-lock check uncovered on that path; sibling-`DeviceNames` and the gfx1250v0-overlay shape run unconditionally via `TensileLogic --check-all` regardless | Medium | Medium | `TensileLogic --check-all` covers two of the three checks regardless of this gap; Math CI's own suite still covers the chip-ID-arch-lock check whenever it runs |  |
| The `_needs_logic_dir` xfail (see [../TESTING.md#known-bugs-and-expected-failures](../TESTING.md#known-bugs-and-expected-failures)) is unconditional in TheRock CI, so the pytest-only logic-corpus checks gated on it never execute there. Only the chip-ID-arch-lock check is actually exposed to this; the other two run unconditionally via `TensileLogic --check-all` regardless | Low | Medium | `TensileLogic --check-all` covers two of the three checks regardless; Math CI's pytest suite can still catch a chip-ID-arch-lock violation when it runs | |
| For gfx1250 specifically, TheRock's `amdgpu_family_matrix.py` has an empty `test-runs-on` for the `gfx125x` family (`gfx125X-dcgpu`, build-only, no runner wired up), so the whole Test stage — including the pytest copies of the logic-corpus consistency checks under `Tensile/Tests/unit` — is skipped outright. Sibling-`DeviceNames` and the gfx1250v0-overlay shape still get build-time coverage there via `TensileLogic --check-all`; only the chip-ID-arch-lock check has no gfx1250 coverage at all | Medium | Medium | `TensileLogic --check-all` runs as a build step, unaffected by the empty `test-runs-on` | |

### Known bugs and flaky tests

| Gap | Regression risk | Impact | Mitigation today | Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A stale `TensileLogic` known-bugs entry only warns, because `--strict-known-bugs` defaults off | Low | Low | The checker re-validates and reports stale entries on every build | AIHPBLAS-4196 |
| The library logic gate has no check name, no test report, and cannot be run in isolation by CI | Low | Medium | It runs on every kernel-generating build including local ones, which gives it good reach | AIHPBLAS-4196 |

### Static analysis and type checking

| Gap | Regression risk | Impact | Mitigation today | Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python linting is configured (`tox -e lint`) but no CI job runs it, and `ignore = E, W` narrows it to pyflakes | Medium | Low | `black` is enforced through `pre-commit`; pyflakes-class bugs are otherwise caught in review |  |
| No type checking on TensileLite, despite type hints being a documented style rule | Medium | Medium | None. A large dynamically typed code generator with no type verification |  |
