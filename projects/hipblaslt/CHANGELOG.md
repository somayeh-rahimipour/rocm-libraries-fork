# Changelog for hipBLASLt

Full documentation for hipBLASLt is available at [rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipBLASLt](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipBLASLt/en/latest/index.html).

## hipBLASLt 1.5.0 for ROCm 10.1.0

### Added

* `FusedGemmA2A` TensileLite problem-type parameter (default `0`, off) that fuses an all-to-all redistribution into the GEMM store path using SDMA, avoiding a separate collective kernel and staging buffer; currently limited to gfx950 and bf16.
* Tensor swizzling (pre-swizzled/pre-tiled A/B tensors) support for gfx11 (WMMA) architectures.
* Batch-offset support for General Batched GEMM on gfx1250.
* gfx1250 v0 ASIC revision support, modeled as a separate `gfx1250v0` architecture identity (selectable via `--architecture=gfx1250v0`, `--gpu-targets gfx1250v0`, or `GlobalParameters.Architecture: gfx1250v0`) that shares ISA `{12,5,0}` and compiler target `gfx1250` but disables TDM multicast and the FP4 32x16 WMMA path, with a dedicated tuned GEMM library subtree selected at runtime by device `asicRevision`; use `install.sh --asic-revision <v0|v1>` or the `HIPBLASLT_ASIC_REVISION` CMake cache variable to build a specific revision, or leave it unset to build both.
* `gbps-bandwidth` (`GbpsBW`) result key in `tensilelite-client` for logging approximate R/W bandwidth in GB/s during performance reporting.
* Complex CGEMM/ZGEMM support for gfx1250.
* `TENSILE_FIXED_WGMXCCSPLITK` environment variable to override the split-K work-group XCC mapping factor for StreamK GEMMs.
* `HIPBLASLT_MATRIX_LAYOUT_OFFSET` matrix-layout attribute for 64-bit element offsets into sub-matrices in General Batched GEMM (`batch_mode=1`), along with `hipblaslt-bench` `batch_offset_a/b/c/d` arguments; nonzero offsets require `HIPBLASLT_BATCH_MODE_POINTER_ARRAY` and are rejected for sub-byte MX types (`HIP_R_6F_E2M3`, `HIP_R_6F_E3M2`, `HIP_R_4F_E2M1`) with `HIPBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

### Changed

* `--global-parameters` and `--benchmark-parameters` values are now parsed as Python literals via `ast.literal_eval` instead of `eval`, correctly handling values containing `=` and rejecting non-literal expressions with an `argparse.ArgumentTypeError`.
* `HIPBLASLT_TENSILE_LIBPATH` and `HIPBLASLT_EXT_OP_LIBRARY_PATH` are now ignored when the process runs in a secure execution context (set-uid/set-gid or other credential-changing exec), falling back to the default library location with a diagnostic; behavior is unchanged for non-privileged processes.
* Enabled gfx1250 cluster-launch kernels for GEMM sizes whose work-group count is not a multiple of `ClusterDim` by padding the launch grid up to a `ClusterDim` multiple and early-exiting the padded work-groups, removing the `ClusterDimCheck` predicate that previously rejected these sizes.
* Stream-K flags are now per-stream: a handle reserves an extra fixed 8 MiB at creation and serves at most 64 distinct streams for Stream-K matmuls (claimed on a stream's first use, held until the handle is destroyed); beyond that the matmul returns `HIPBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR`.
* Stream-K workspace size reported by the heuristic APIs is now smaller, and the SK grid is bounded, so `TENSILE_STREAMK_GRID_MULTIPLIER` values past that bound no longer take effect.
* Solution cache key now includes `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_SM_COUNT_TARGET` and the StreamK tile scheduling mode, so the same problem can select a different kernel than before.

### Removed

* Removed the OpenCL runtime backend from TensileLite: `RuntimeLanguage: OCL` (`--runtime-language OCL`), the `-p`/`--platform` option and `Platform` global parameter, and the `platform-idx` client option are no longer accepted, leaving only `HIP` and `HSA`.

### Optimized

* Improved gfx950 GEMM performance by updating Origami solution libraries with work-stealing support and additional tuned TF32 and MX kernels.
* Improved split-K GEMM performance with a K-first work-group reordering (K-Coherent) approach that increases L2 cache reuse across K-slices.

### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results (`beta` applied twice) for `AdaptiveGemmGSUA` GEMMs that resolve to MultipleBuffer accumulation with a non-zero `beta`.
* Fixed out-of-bounds tensor loads in the single-wave TDM kernel for edge (non-tile-aligned) `M`/`N` sizes on gfx1250, which could produce incorrect results.
* Fixed a Stream-K flag-region overrun on dynamic-queue paths (`StreamK=4` and the SK4 sub-path of `StreamK=5`) where a grid scaled via `TENSILE_STREAMK_GRID_MULTIPLIER` could write past its own region.
* Fixed a deadlock in the Stream-K remainder path when concurrent GEMMs ran on multiple streams sharing one handle, where the process hung with the GPU at 100% and no HIP error reported.
* Fixed a race condition in StreamK (SK4/SK5) kernels where untokened mailbox `ds_store`/`ds_load` operations could overlap with LDS0 traffic, and incorrect results in SK5 hybrid StreamK caused by AND-masking the live `MagicShiftItersPerTile` register that corrupted the aliased `SKTiles` overlay.
* Fixed intermittent nonfinite (`NaN`/`Inf`) values in `hipblasLtMatmul` output on gfx950 caused by the first MFMA instruction executing before pre-loop local-data-share reads completed, affecting kernels using custom main-loop scheduling with forced unroll subiterations.
* Fixed a missing wait for VALU-to-global-atomic/store read-after-write dependencies under expert scheduling mode 2 on gfx1250, which could leave the StreamK dynamic work-queue counter dirty and produce nondeterministic incorrect results.
* Restored the StinkyTofu ESM2 scheduling path for sparse SpMM problem types on gfx1250 after resolving the intermittent correctness failures that previously required disabling it.
* Fixed a cross-wave read-after-write race in triple LDS buffering (`TDMPlusLdsBuf`) that could produce incorrect results; triple buffering now falls back to double buffering.
* Fixed incorrect results for general-batched (pointer-array) GEMM on gfx1250 in the TDM path, where A/B batch pointers were not dereferenced before tile-offset arithmetic.
* Fixed out-of-bounds GSU synchronizer pointer arithmetic for grouped GEMMs with more than 16 problems, which handed later problems a pointer past the end of the synchronizer allocation on gfx942 and gfx90a.
* Fixed nondeterministic wrong results on gfx1250 caused by read-token races in the `TDMSplit` load path, which is now disabled (rejected during solution selection) until a complete fix lands.
* Fixed out-of-bounds global memory reads in TDM iterate mode (`iterate_enable`) when a workgroup processed a partial tile.
* Fixed incorrect kernel selection for very large `K` problems where Dot2 kernels were mistakenly parameterized as Stream-K kernels.
* Fixed a `branch size exceeds simm16` build failure caused by replay hazard protection enlarging the loop body, by emitting a 32-bit branch sequence for the backward branch.
* Fixed an SGPR budget overflow in gfx1250 StreamK GEMM kernels using wave-separated TDM stagger (for example `PrefetchGL2=1` with `StreamKForceDPOnly=0`) that caused affected kernels to write nothing and produce incorrect results for MX-FP8 and MX-FP4 problems.
* Fixed an `hipErrorIllegalAddress` crash on gfx1201 (RDNA4) for GEMMs using DirectToVgpr transpose loads (`global_load_tr`) when the free dimension is not a multiple of the macro-tile, caused by an out-of-bounds read past the operand.
* Fixed an intermittent `SIGBUS` crash in the `tensilelite-client` hardware-monitoring thread on gfx1151 caused by out-of-bounds indexing of `amdsmi_frequencies_t::frequency[]` when a clock domain is power-gated.
* Fixed silent build failures when the assembler binary is missing or not executable; `rocisa` now raises a `RuntimeError` naming the assembler path instead of returning an empty capability map.
* Fixed incorrect results for XFP32 (`F32XdlMathOp: X`) GEMM on gfx1250 where the transpose could overwrite local-read data before it landed, along with an SGPR double-checkout error affecting XFP32 emulation kernels.
* Fixed a possible page fault or silent data corruption on gfx1250 caused by an xnack replay hazard in multi-dword SMEM loads (`SLoadB64`) where the destination and base address registers overlapped.
* Fixed a hang and stale partial reads on gfx1250 in the StreamK dynamic and hybrid fixup paths caused by a missing acquire fence on the partial-tile flag read.
* Corrected `PhysicalMaxVgprCU` for gfx1102 and gfx1103, where gfx1103 was reported with a 1536-VGPR per-SIMD file instead of 1024 and gfx1102 omitted the two-SIMDs-per-CU factor, both affecting occupancy and kernel selection.
* Fixed a StreamK per-XCD work-queue counter that failed to reset between launches when the StreamK grid size was not a multiple of the XCD count, causing progressively slower execution on repeated GEMM launches (`WorkGroupMappingXCC == -1` and `StreamKXCCMapping` chiplet-remap paths).
* Fixed out-of-bounds stores in subtile GEMM kernels on gfx950 and gfx1250 when the `M` dimension does not evenly fill the macro tile (for example `M=8` with a 32-row tile).

## hipBLASLt 1.4.1 for ROCm 7.14

### Added

* Introduced a new API: hipBLASLt-ext::isSolutionSupported(). This API is used by new hipBLASLt integration from rocBLAS to check if a given solution is supported for a certain GPU and Problem Type. 
* `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_UNIFORM_SUMMATION_ORDER_EXT`,
  `hipblaslt_ext::GemmPreference::setUniformSummationOrder`, and
  `hipblasLtSetUniformSummationOrder` / `hipblasLtGetUniformSummationOrder`
  opt into a uniform summation order across `M` (not run-to-run determinism).
  See `hipblaslt.h`. `hipblaslt-bench --uniform_summation_order` forwards
  the descriptor attribute.

## hipBLASLt 1.4.0

### Added

* Complex datatype support for gfx942 and gfx950.
* `hipblasLtSetSmCountTarget()` / `hipblasLtGetSmCountTarget()` handle-level
  helpers (the analogue of cuBLAS's `cublasSetSmCountTarget` /
  `cublasGetSmCountTarget`). `int32_t`, default `0` meaning "use all
  compute units"; negative values are rejected with
  `HIPBLAS_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`.
* `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_SM_COUNT_TARGET` matmul-descriptor attribute and
  `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_PREF_SM_COUNT_TARGET` preference attribute (same
  semantics). When a per-matmul / per-preference value is non-zero it
  takes precedence over the handle-level value. Lets callers convey an
  estimate of how many CUs hipBLASLt should target for kernel selection
  and persistent-grid sizing — useful when another kernel (e.g. RCCL)
  is co-running on the device or when a persistent grid should be sized
  for a known CU budget. (This is a hint, not a CU reservation.)
* `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_STREAMK_TILE_SCHEDULING_EXT` and matching ext API
  (`setStreamKTileSchedulingMode()` / `getStreamKTileSchedulingMode()`) accept
  the tri-state `hipblasLtStreamKTileSchedulingMode_t` enum (OFF=0 static SK3,
  ON=1 dynamic SK4, AUTO=2 origami heuristic). Invalid values return
  `HIPBLAS_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`. `hipblaslt-bench` `--streamk_tile_scheduling`
  and `--sm_count_target` forward into the matmul descriptor
  (see `clients/bench/README.md`).

### Changed

* StreamK=5 tile scheduling default is now `OFF` (`0`, static SK3 sub-path)
  instead of `AUTO` (`2`). Set `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_SM_COUNT_TARGET` (or
  `hipblasLtSetSmCountTarget`) to a positive value to engage the origami
  hybrid-mode heuristic per launch even when the mode is `OFF`; use
  `HIPBLASLT_STREAMK_TILE_SCHEDULING_AUTO` (`2`) to always delegate to the
  heuristic regardless of `sm_count_target`.

## hipBLASLt 1.3.0

### Added

* General Batched GEMM support.
* `HIPBLASLT_CHECK_NUMERICS` environment variable: opt-in post-GEMM NaN
  scanner for `hipblasLtMatmul` output (D matrix). Accepts numeric
  (`1`, `2`) or word values (`info`, `warn`, `none`/`off`). Output goes
  to the standard hipBLASLt log sink (or `stderr` if no log sink is
  configured). Per-call cost is one scanner kernel launch only -- no
  `hipStreamSynchronize`, no per-call alloc/free. A persistent 4-byte
  device flag is allocated once in the handle constructor and drained
  once at handle destruction with a single `hipDeviceSynchronize`;
  a teardown log line reports the first matmul call_id at which NaN
  was observed (or that none was, with a sampling caveat when the
  scanner only ran on a subset of calls). Companion env vars allow
  sampling (`HIPBLASLT_CHECK_NUMERICS_SCAN_EVERY`) and a bisect window
  (`HIPBLASLT_CHECK_NUMERICS_SCAN_FROM` / `_SCAN_UNTIL`). A C API
  `hipblasLtCheckNumericsDrain(handle, &first_nan_call_id)` lets
  frameworks drive a drain on demand.

### Changed

* Replaced `install.sh` with an invoke-based task runner (`tasks.py`) to support cross-platform builds including Windows (ROCm 7.0+).
* gtest and msgpack-cxx are now fetched automatically via CMake FetchContent if not found on the system.
* Greatly improved MXFP4 GEMM performance when using HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_MATRIX_SCALE_BLK32_UE8M0_32_8_EXT

## hipBLASLt 1.1.0 for ROCm 7.1.0

### Added

* Fused Clamp GEMM for ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_EXT`` and ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_BIAS_EXT``. This feature requires the minimum (``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_EPILOGUE_ACT_ARG0_EXT``) and maximum (``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_EPILOGUE_ACT_ARG1_EXT``) to be set.
* Support for ReLU/Clamp activation functions with auxiliary output for the `f16` and `bf16` data types for gfx942 to capture intermediate results. This feature is enabled for ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_RELU_AUX``, ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_RELU_AUX_BIAS``, ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_AUX_EXT``, and ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_AUX_BIAS_EXT``.
* Support for `HIPBLAS_COMPUTE_32F_FAST_16BF` for FP32 data type for gfx950 only.
* Added the CPP extension APIs ``setMaxWorkspaceBytes`` and ``getMaxWorkspaceBytes``.
* Added the ability to print logs (using ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=32``) for Grouped GEMM.
* Support for swizzleA by using the hipblaslt-ext cpp API.
* Support for hipBLASLt extop for gfx11xx and gfx12xx.

### Changed

## hipBLASLt 1.0.0 for ROCm 7.0.0

### Added

* Stream-K GEMM support has been enabled for the `FP32`, `FP16`, `BF16`, `FP8`, and `BF8` data types on the MI300A APU. To activate this feature, set the `TENSILE_SOLUTION_SELECTION_METHOD` environment variable to `2`, for example, `export TENSILE_SOLUTION_SELECTION_METHOD=2`.
* Fused Swish/SiLU GEMM in hipBLASLt (enabled by ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_SWISH_EXT`` and ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_SWISH_BIAS_EXT``)
* Added support for ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_GELU_AUX_BIAS`` for gfx942
* Added `HIPBLASLT_TUNING_USER_MAX_WORKSPACE` to constrain max workspace size for user offline tuning

* The non-V2 APIs (``GemmPreference``, ``GemmProblemType``, ``GemmEpilogue``, ``GemmTuning``, ``GemmInputs``) in the Cpp header are now the same as the V2 APIs (``GemmPreferenceV2``, ``GemmProblemTypeV2``, ``GemmEpilogueV2``, ``GemmTuningV2``, ``GemmInputsV2``). The original non-V2 APIs are removed.
* `hipblasltExtAMaxWithScale` API is removed.

### Optimized

* Improved performance for 8-bit (FP8/BF8/I8) NN/NT cases by adding ``s_delay_alu`` to reduce stalls from dependent ALU operations on gfx12+.
* Improved performance for 8-bit and 16-bit (FP16/BF16) TN cases by enabling software dependency check (Expert Scheduling Mode) under certain restrictions to reduce redundant hardware dependency checks on gfx12+.
* Improved performance for 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit batched GEMM with a better heuristic search algorithm for gfx942.

### Upcoming changes

* V2 APIs (``GemmPreferenceV2``, ``GemmProblemTypeV2``, ``GemmEpilogueV2``, ``GemmTuningV2``, ``GemmInputsV2``) are deprecated.
