/**
 * @brief Retrieves the human-readable name of a specific engine.
 *
 * Introduced in engine plugin API 1.4.0 and optional: the host keys off symbol
 * export alone, ignoring the API version the plugin reports. A plugin that does
 * not export it, or that answers HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE, has its
 * engines named by the host instead. Any other non-success status is a defect
 * rather than a way to decline, and costs that engine its place: the host drops
 * it from enumeration, routing and dispatch, while the rest of the plugin loads.
 *
 * The host resolves a name from this entry point, then the built-in registry in
 * EngineNames.hpp, then a hexadecimal rendering of the engine ID. Implementing
 * this entry point is the only way a plugin can name its own engines. See
 * "Engine names" in docs/user-guides/how-to/develop-plugins.rst.
 *
 * The name is a key, not just a display label: the engine ID must equal its hash,
 * engineNameToId(name) == engine_id, using the FNV-1a definition in
 * EngineNames.hpp. Deriving both from HIPDNN_REGISTER_ENGINE satisfies this by
 * construction. The host verifies it at load time and drops any engine that
 * fails, logging an error; the rest of the plugin still loads. An engine whose ID
 * an earlier plugin already provides is likewise dropped, which together with the
 * hash rule makes names unique across loaded plugins.
 *
 * @param[in] engine_id Engine ID (must come from hipdnnEnginePluginGetAllEngineIds).
 * @param[out] name Receives a NUL-terminated string owned by the plugin. Must
 *                  remain valid for the lifetime of the loaded library. On any
 *                  status other than HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_SUCCESS the value is
 *                  unspecified and the host must not read it. NULL or empty
 *                  alongside SUCCESS leaves the engine unnamed, exactly as
 *                  HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE would.
 * @return HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_SUCCESS on success;
 *         HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE if this plugin supplies no name for
 *         engine_id — the generated default for containers that do not implement
 *         getEngineName, and the answer to give for an engine_id the plugin does
 *         not recognise, since it is the only penalty-free decline;
 *         HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM if name is NULL. The host never passes
