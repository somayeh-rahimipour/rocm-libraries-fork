# RFC 0019: Universal Heuristic Descriptor (UHD): Data-Driven Kernel Selection

- Contributors: Jason Campbell, Chris Erb
- Parent: [RFC 0017 Universal Kernel Descriptor](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md) — the "UHD + kernel selection" follow-up named in [RFC 0017 §14.2](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#142-follow-up-rfcs).
- Siblings:
  - [RFC 0020 Universal Engine Descriptor](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md) — owns engine identity, the UED's `nodes` pattern, and the **symbol table matching it publishes**. That table is the binding this RFC's `features_signature` reads, and the set every UHD is validated against ([Section 6.1](#61-feature-sources), [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)).
  - [RFC 0018 Universal Match Descriptor](0018_UniversalMatchDescriptor.md) — the UMD's criteria, applicability evaluated over that same table. A sibling consumer of the binding, not its owner.
  - The **descriptor expression language**, the shared syntax criteria, dispatch formulas, and feature entries are written in. Specified in its own follow-up; see [Open Question 15](#operational).

- Series: **0018** is the UMD's criteria, **0019** is this document (UHD + kernel selection), **0020** is the UED, graph matching, and symbol binding.

Sections marked **OPEN** identify decisions deferred to review or to a named follow-up. The design is
grounded in the heuristic-generation tooling — a training-and-export pipeline any package author runs to
produce a heuristic for their own kernels — and in rocKE's selection path.

## 1. Overview

A **UHD (Universal Heuristic Descriptor)** is a kernel-selection model stored as data, an individual,
reusable descriptor referenced by ID (a GUID). Given multiple kernels that apply to a graph, the UHD
ranks them and picks the best one. It replaces hand-coded dispatch logic with a declarative, drop-in
artifact.

The **UED (engine) owns its UHDs**: up to three role-scoped heuristics, arch-keyed, shared by every
pack that joins the engine ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)). The central one,
`sort_kernel_catalog`, ranks the catalog; unqualified "the UHD" below refers to it. The UED also owns the
**KMD (Kernel Metadata Descriptor)**, the explicit declaration of compilation knobs (tile size, block
size, split-K, dtype, and the like, each with a type and optional default) that distinguish kernel
variants. The KMD is the feature space the ranker ranks over, so the two are coupled: a *breaking* KMD
change forces a retrain, while additive changes and dispatch-only fields do not
([Section 3.3](#33-coupling-rules)).

This RFC defines:

1. **UHD schema** — how a selection model is described as data ([Section 4](#4-uhd-schema))
2. **Ownership model** — the UED owns its role-scoped UHDs and one KMD; KDPs join the engine ([Section 3](#3-ownership-model))
3. **Selection flow** — how a UHD ranks matched kernels ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow))
4. **Engine integration** — matcher applicability bubbles up before engines are ranked, and the UHD runs
   only after that, on demand. The generation tooling produces an engine-level estimate
   (`predict_engine`) and the catalog ranker (`sort_kernel_catalog`), one of each per **ranking metric**
   (throughput, time, and future metrics, [Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)); two engine-selection
   policies (quick and thorough) consume them in the metric a request names, with a rank-ordering
   fallback ([Section 10–11](#10-applicability-flow)). The policies remain a
   [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md) follow-up; this RFC supplies the heuristics and
   keeps the schema from foreclosing cross-engine comparison.
5. **Generation pipeline** — automated benchmarking and model export ([Section 13](#13-model-generation-pipeline))

## 2. Scope

| Level | Question | Owner |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Engine selection** | Which engine handles this graph? | [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md) |
| **Kernel selection** | Which kernel within the engine? | **UHD** (this RFC) |

The UHD's central role, `sort_kernel_catalog`, is the kernel-selection heuristic, and it is what this
RFC is mostly about. The other two roles sit either side of it: `predict_engine` supplies an
input to engine selection, and `predict_applicable_kernels` produces the candidate set
([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)). All three are part of the generic provider that
[RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md) introduces — not a new host interface, not a policy
plugin. Supplying an input to engine selection does not move ownership of it: the policies remain
[RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md)'s. The two levels are not cleanly one-after-the-other, but the interleaving is specifically between
the **matcher** and engine selection — *not* between the UHD and engine selection
([Section 10](#10-applicability-flow)).

- **Matcher applicability bubbles up first.** Before engine selection can rank anything, it must know
  which engines even apply. For a descriptor engine, "do I apply?" is the **matcher (UMD) pass** at the
  descriptor layer; that result **bubbles up** so non-viable engines are ruled out *before* the first
  plugin-policy layer ranks the survivors. It is the **matcher** that runs ahead of engine selection.
- **The UHD runs strictly after applicability, and only on demand.** A UHD is never loaded or evaluated
  to decide applicability, and never eagerly. It runs when — and only when — something asks for a result
  that requires the ranked catalog: a policy requesting a performance estimate, a knob query needing the
  top-ranked default, or kernel selection for a winning engine. A policy that never asks (explicit user
  selection, criteria-based selection) never loads it ([Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching)).
- **The UHD's predictions *can* feed engine selection.** The generation tooling produces a cheap
  engine-level **expected-performance** estimate and the fine-grained config UHD; engine-selection
  policies **may** consume those to rank engines *by predicted performance*
  ([Section 10](#10-applicability-flow)) — a possible input, not a requirement, and policies are free to
  ignore them entirely. The policies themselves remain
  [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md)'s territory; this RFC provides the heuristics
  they may consult.

**In scope:** the UHD schema; ranking semantics over a pack's matched UKDs; selection-group membership
(the UED owns the UHD and KMD; a KDP joins the engine) and how KMD fields, UKD metadata, and the knobs
an engine exposes relate; the feature contract; model formats and their adapter seam; dependency
constraints; load/eval performance; the model-generation pipeline.

**Out of scope (this RFC):** the engine-selection outer loop itself ([RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md)
owns it); autotuning / exhaustive search (device-access tuning is [RFC 0013](0013_Autotune.md)); the
matcher and launch machinery ([RFC 0017 §5–6](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#5-matching-the-ueds-pattern-and-the-umds-criteria)).

**An engine names up to three role-scoped UHDs, each mapped by architecture** ([RFC 0020 §4.6](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md)):

| UED field | Role | When it runs | This RFC |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sort_kernel_catalog` | Ranks the catalog, picks the winning kernel | Kernel selection, after applicability | the main subject — the "config UHD" throughout |
| `predict_engine` | Cheap `f(graph) → expected perf` estimate | Engine selection, before any catalog is built | [Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker)'s engine estimate |
| `predict_applicable_kernels` | Generates the candidate set to be ranked | During applicability, combinatorial/JIT case | [Section 4.3](#43-future-predict_applicable_kernels-when-there-is-no-catalog-to-rank)'s candidate generator |

The roles run in pipeline order, which follows the applicability boundary rather than the table order
above:

1. `predict_applicable_kernels` — **during** applicability, producing the candidate set for an engine
   whose catalog is not enumerable ([Section 4.3](#43-future-predict_applicable_kernels-when-there-is-no-catalog-to-rank));
2. `predict_engine` — at **engine selection**, which runs only over engines already found
   applicable, so a policy can rank them by predicted performance;
3. `sort_kernel_catalog` — at **kernel selection**, ranking the surviving catalog and picking a winner.

Only the first runs before applicability is settled; the other two run after it
([Section 10](#10-applicability-flow)). Each role is **independently optional**, and each value is an
**arch → UHD ids** map resolved by exact `gcnArchName`, then a `default` entry, then unavailable
([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)). Almost everything in this RFC
concerns `sort_kernel_catalog`; where a statement is specific to another role it says so. `knobs` derives
from `sort_kernel_catalog`'s `$kernel.*` feature axes and no other ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)).

Three named fields, rather than a single id or an ordered list, keep each role independently optional
and independently versioned, let a loader resolve exactly the role a request needs without walking a
list, and give the two secondary roles (`predict_engine`, `predict_applicable_kernels`) a defined
home. `predict_applicable_kernels` runs *during* applicability, ahead of the
[Section 10](#10-applicability-flow) rule that the UHD runs strictly after it; that section records it as
the one exception.

**Several UHDs per role, one per ranking metric.** An engine may be ranked by more than one quantity —
throughput, time, accuracy, and metrics not yet defined ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)) — and a
model trained on one says nothing about another. So `sort_kernel_catalog` and `predict_engine` map each
architecture to a **list** of UHD ids rather than one, and the loader indexes the list by the metric
each UHD declares in its own `score.metric`:

- **The metric lives in the UHD, never in the UED.** A model's metric is what it was trained on, a fact
  about the artifact; restating it in the role map would be a second copy that can disagree with the
  first. The UED says *which* models the engine binds; each model says what it measures.
- **One UHD per (role, architecture key, metric).** Two UHDs in one list declaring the same metric are a
  load error for that architecture key: there is no rule that could choose between them, and picking
  either silently would make the ranking depend on list order.
- **Arch fallback is per metric.** A `(gfx942, time)` lookup falls back to `(default, time)`, never to
  `(gfx942, tflops)`. Crossing metrics would substitute a number in the wrong units.
- **A single id is a one-element list.** An existing role map needs no rewrite.
- **A catalog ranker need not declare a metric.** A `sort_kernel_catalog` UHD with no `score.metric`
  (a `native` comparator, a `static_order`) orders its catalog but produces no comparable number. It is
  the engine's **default ranker**, used when no metric is requested or the requested one has no ranker;
  at most one per architecture key. Every `predict_engine` UHD must declare a metric
  ([Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker)).

`predict_applicable_kernels` stays single-valued: it generates the candidate set rather than scoring
it, so it has no metric to key on.

### 3.2 KMD Fields, and Knobs as the Heuristic's Feature Axes

There is **one** space of variant fields, not two.
[RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md) establishes it: the **KMD declares the engine's variant
fields** (name, type, optional default), each UKD's `metadata` fills them, and a **knob is a KMD field
the engine exposes to the user** — a *name*, nothing more.

**The exposed set is not arbitrary. `UED.knobs` is the engine's public tuning surface, and the UHD's
kernel-side feature axes are a subset of it.**

| Concept | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **KMD fields** | **KMD** `fields`, filled by each UKD's `metadata` | The engine's full variant space (`tile_m`, `warp_n`, `split_k`, `dtype`, plus any dispatch-only fields a UDD consumes). |
| **Knobs** | **UED** `knobs`: a list of **field names** | The KMD fields the engine exposes for a caller to pin. Authored by the engine, and a superset of the `$kernel.*` fields the UHD reads. |

**This governs `$kernel.*` only.** A UHD's feature vector also draws on the problem (`$q.*`,
`$<node>.*`) and the device (`$device.*`), and computes values over all three inline
([Section 6.1](#61-feature-sources)). None of those are knobs, and none should be: a knob is something a
caller can *set*, and nobody sets the sequence length or the CU count as a way of picking a kernel. The
rule concerns the one namespace where a feature axis and a user-settable choice can be the same thing.

Within that namespace the containment runs one way, and the asymmetry is the whole rule:

- **Every axis the model ranks on is reachable by the caller.** A model splitting on a field the UED
  does not expose is a load error. Selection would then depend on something no caller can vary — a dial
  hidden behind the result, which is worse than no dial at all. Note *reachable*: `$kernel.*` references
  nested inside a computed feature count too, so `{"ceil_div": ["$q.dims[2]", "$kernel.tile_m0"]}`
  requires `tile_m0` to be exposed even though the signature never names it on its own
  ([Section 6.2](#62-the-features_signature)).
- **A knob the model does not read stays exposed.** Training has no standing to withdraw it. The knob
  list is read by the engine's UMDs and by callers who tune, so it is the engine's to author and the
  engine's to change; a knob whose training column carried one value is simply a dial the current model
  cannot use. This is **reported at load**, so an unread dial is visible and the author can decide,
  never fatal.
- **Non-knob KMD fields are dispatch-only, and invisible to selection.** `UHD features ⊆ KMD fields`
  still holds; what is new is that the *complement* has a defined role — launch geometry and workspace
  detail a UDD reads ([Section 3.3](#33-coupling-rules)). The heuristic cannot rank on them.
- **Two kernels differing only in fields the model does not read are indistinguishable to it,** so they
  score identically and the deterministic `priority`-then-`id` tie-break decides
  ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)). The loader emits a **warning** in this case: a pack carrying kernels
  the heuristic cannot choose between indicates either a missing feature or a redundant variant. Which of
  the three remedies applies — expose the distinguishing field and retrain on it, move the variants to a
  separate **engine**, or drop them — is the kernel author's judgement, and this RFC sets no rule for it.
  A separate *pack* is not among them: the catalog is engine-scoped, so a new KDP joining the same engine
  contributes to the same catalog under the same heuristic and separates nothing. The
  considerations that bear on it: **variant explosion**, since every added knob multiplies the space the
  generation pipeline must cover ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)); whether the
  variants differ in **function** rather than only in performance, which argues for a separate engine
  ([Section 3.3](#33-coupling-rules)); and whether a candidate knob **changes the meaning of other knobs**,
  which makes the feature space conditional and is poorly modelled by a single flat ranker.
- **A knob change is an engine change; a feature change is not.** Adding, removing, or renaming a knob
  is authored, and moves the UED's content revision. Retraining moves the UHD alone, as long as the new
  feature set still fits inside the declared knobs
  ([Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling)).

**Benchmark wide, expose what the caller needs.** Generation still sweeps the full space — every
addressable KMD field is exposed on the *generation* UED so every kernel is individually addressable and
timeable ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)). Feature selection then prunes the axes
that do not earn their place **in the model**. The **emitted** UED keeps the engine's authored knobs,
and the surviving feature set is checked to be contained in them.

**Consequence: the public knob list is stable under retraining.** A retrain that drops `split_k` as a
feature does not remove it as a knob, so a caller pinning it keeps working and the engine's UMDs keep
reading a list that did not move underneath them. What the retrain produces is a **warning** — a dial
the heuristic no longer reads — and the engine's author decides whether to withdraw it. That withdrawal
is a deliberate engine change and a **breaking content-revision** bump on the UED
([Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling)), which disables a stale model and marks the
API break without moving the file-format version that would orphan the descriptor outright.

This also settles what an engine with **no UHD** exposes: its authored knobs, exactly as one with a UHD
does. A caller can pin a kernel on a pack that has never been benchmarked, which would be impossible if
the knob list were a product of training.

- **A knob's legal values come from the *catalog*, not the schema** — the values the field actually takes
  among the kernels matching *this* graph, never the KMD's theoretical range. Critically, the API reports
  each knob's values **independently**, so **the cross-product of legal knob values is not the set of
  legal kernels.** Given kernels `(split_k, tile_m) ∈ {(0,0), (1,1)}`, both knobs report the range
  `{0,1}` and the cross-product suggests four combinations — but `(0,1)` and `(1,0)` match no kernel.
  Nothing in the knob-range report expresses which *combinations* are valid, and for a sparse catalog
  over many knobs the valid set is a vanishing fraction of the cross-product. Generation therefore never
  reconstructs candidates from knob ranges: it enumerates the applicable catalog directly and enrolls
  what it finds ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)).
- **A knob's default is the UHD's choice.** Whatever the heuristic ranks first is the reported default, so
  leaving knobs alone reproduces the out-of-the-box selection. **This is one of the demand triggers that
  loads the UHD:** answering a knob query means ranking that engine's catalog — see
  [Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching).

**Knob ranges need a step, not just bounds.** Where a knob is numeric and its values are regular, the
descriptor should carry `[min, max, step]` rather than bare bounds, so a consumer can enumerate the axis
without guessing the increment. At runtime the reported range narrows to what the applicable catalog
actually contains, but the step is forwarded unchanged. **OPEN:** whether the step lives on the KMD field
(a property of the variant axis) or on the UED knob (a property of the exposure).

Filtering and ranking **commute**: setting `split_k = 4` keeps only kernels whose `split_k` is 4 and the
UHD ranks those. That holds only because **`sort_kernel_catalog` scores each kernel on its own metadata
and the problem, never relative to the rest of the catalog** — a hard requirement on any adapter serving
that role ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)), not an assumption. A scorer that normalizes across the
candidate set is out of scope for it.

Two conditions carry that property, not one. Per-candidate scoring makes the *successful* path commute.
The failure path commutes because the decision to use the model at all is made once, over the full
applicable catalog, before any filter narrows it ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow) step 8) — a fallback
chosen per subset would let the same inputs produce different winners depending on whether the filter or
the ranking ran first. Both the scoring rule and the fallback's granularity are part of the contract.

The constraint is scoped to that role deliberately. `predict_engine` takes no candidate at all, and
`predict_applicable_kernels` *produces* a candidate set rather than scoring one
([Section 4.3](#43-future-predict_applicable_kernels-when-there-is-no-catalog-to-rank)); neither is a
per-candidate scorer, so neither is bound by the commuting requirement.

**Knobs are dynamic choices, not a static parameter space.** A knob does not describe a dimension the
user may freely set; it names a field whose *currently selectable values* are whatever the applicable
catalog happens to contain for this graph. The same knob can report `{64, 128, 256}` for one graph and
`{128}` for another, because applicability differs per graph. The API therefore guarantees that each
reported value is achievable *on its own*, and nothing more — combining values across knobs may name a
kernel that does not exist, and setting knobs that jointly match nothing is a legitimate empty result,
not an internal error. The distinction that matters is **who sets the value**: the kernel's build (every
KMD field, as `metadata`) versus the user (the exposed subset — which is the heuristic's feature set).

### 3.3 Coupling Rules

**The KMD is the schema for `$kernel.*`, and the UED owns both it and the UHD.** The UED references one
KMD and, per architecture and metric, one `sort_kernel_catalog` UHD ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)), and every child UKD's `metadata` fills the KMD's fields, validated
at load. The KMD is the feature space the UHD ranks over, so the two are coupled. The coupling is
conditional, matching [RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md):

- **Additive KMD change** — a new field, or new legal values on an existing field — **requires no
  retrain until that change is exposed to selection.** The old feature space is still valid, so the
  existing model keeps ranking correctly; a field the UHD never reads costs it nothing.
- **Breaking KMD change** — removing or reinterpreting an existing field's values — **must land its
  retrain in the same change**, because a field the model was not trained on is not selected against
  until it learns it.

**The KMD is a *superset* of the UHD's features, not equal to it.** All `$kernel.*` fields the UHD ranks
on must be in the KMD, but the KMD may also carry fields the UHD never reads — values a **UDD** formula
consumes for per-kernel dispatch detail (launch geometry, workspace). So the relationship is
`UHD features ⊆ KMD fields`, and an additive field added purely for dispatch never touches the heuristic.
This gives the UHD a firm, checkable contract:

- **A UKD is one point in the KMD-declared field space** — its `metadata`, which is its unique key
  engine-wide and is validated as such at load. The model, however, only sees that point's projection
  onto the **knob** axes ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)); two kernels
  sharing a projection are indistinguishable to it and are separated by the deterministic tie-break.
- **The collection of those points is the KDP** (a pack joining one engine, adding a matcher set, a UDD,
  and the kernel vector); the **UHD and KMD belong to the UED (engine)**, shared by every pack that joins
  it. `arch` is a KDP property, so one engine — and its UHDs/KMD — spans arches, with per-arch model
  selection handled by the UED's arch-keyed heuristic maps ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)).
- **The UHD's `$kernel.*` references must be a subset of the KMD fields, and must equal the UED's
  knobs** — a two-part load-time check ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)). The KMD is the
  authority on *what fields exist*; the UHD picks *which subset* it ranks on and how it derives from
  them; the UED's `knobs` must then name exactly that subset. The fields left over serve the UDD.

**Engine-scoped, never per-pack.** Many KDPs may join the same engine and share its heuristics. A UHD
is never inlined per kernel or per pack; the UED names one per role, and one per arch within a role
([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)).

**Arch-aware via `$device.*`.** A UHD spans architectures; `arch` is a KDP property, not a UHD property.
A pack carries a list of GFX targets (empty meaning arch-independent), matched exactly against the device
and gated before any matcher runs. A mapped model takes `$device.*` features (CU count, LDS size, and the
like) and generalizes across the arches its engine serves. Two mechanisms handle arch differentiation:
the arch-keyed heuristic maps ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)) select a distinct model where
architectures diverge, and `$device.*` features cover within-model variation where they overlap. Where an
arch needs different metadata or materially different heuristic behavior, it is served by a separate
engine rather than folded into one model. **OPEN:** See [Open Question 2](#schema-and-training)
(arch-aware model scope).

## 4. UHD Schema

A UHD is a small, reusable scoring recipe. It names an `adapter` (ranking mechanism), a
`features_signature` (model inputs), an objective, and — for model adapters — a model artifact.

Because a UED spans arches (`arch` is a KDP property in [RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md)),
a UHD is **per-engine and arch-aware**: one model taking `$device.*` features so it generalizes across
the arches its engine serves — not one model per arch.

A UHD has two parts: a universal header every UHD carries, and an adapter-scoped body. The loader reads
the header before it instantiates an adapter implementation; the body is opaque to everything except that
adapter. This separation keeps a new adapter from touching the header schema, and lets a loader validate
identity, versioning, and the feature contract without understanding the ranking mechanism.

```jsonc
// tree_data — the default; a GBDT tree table, shipped as data with the engine's descriptor set
{
  // ── universal header (every UHD, every adapter) ──────────────────────────────
  "version": "1.0",                                    // major.minor; gated at load (Section 8.1)
  "id":      "ae896b07-80cd-473c-b3f4-6a8892998519",   // GUID; referenced by a UED heuristic role
  "name":    "rocKE FMHA fwd selector",                // arch-aware; the UED maps arches to UHDs
  "adapter": "tree_data",                              // discriminant: selects the body schema (Section 7)

  // ordered model inputs; order + form must match training (Section 6)
  "features_signature": [
    "$device.cu_count", "$device.lds_size",            // device props → arch-aware
    "$kernel.tile_m", "$kernel.split_k",               // KMD fields, exposed as knobs (Section 3.2)
    "$q.dims[3]", "$q.dims[2]",                        // positional tensor dims (Section 6.1)
    {"/": ["$sdpa_fwd.flops", "$sdpa_fwd.bytes"]},     // computed inline — no $derived.* (Section 6.4)
    {"ceil_div": ["$q.dims[2]", "$kernel.tile_m"]}    // tile quantization, also inline
  ],
  "categorical_encoding": { … },                       // string → code maps, generated (Section 6.5)
  "features_hash": "sha256:…",                         // contract guard: signature + encoding

  // the descriptor content revisions this heuristic was generated against (Section 8.1)
  "trained_against": {
    "kmd": {"id": "5a1c0000-…", "revision": "2.1"},
    "ued": {"id": "7f30b911-…", "revision": "1.3"},
    "umd": [{"id": "1a7f52c8-…", "revision": "1.0"}] // one entry per matcher
  },

  "objective": "max",                                  // higher predicted score wins
  "score": {"metric": "tflops", "calibrated": true, "transform": "log1p"},  // recover TFLOPS → Sections 4.4, 12

  // ── adapter-scoped body: key MUST equal the `adapter` value ──────────────────
  "tree_data": {
    "artifact": "fmha_fwd/model.bin"                   // ships as data with the engine descriptors
  }
}
```

Other adapters keep the same header and swap the body:

```jsonc
// native — a compiled scorer resolved by symbol name; the first adapter to land (Section 7.1)
{ …, "adapter": "native",
  "native": {"symbol": "rocke_fmha_fwd_score"} }       // resolved from the engine's registered symbols

// onnx — dependency-gated (Section 7)
{ …, "adapter": "onnx",
  "onnx": {"artifact": "fmha_fwd/model.onnx"} }

// static_order — no features, no hash, no model
{ "version": "1.0", "id": "…", "name": "…", "adapter": "static_order",
  "static_order": {"order": ["priority", "id"]} }

// custom_library — author-shipped .so behind a C ABI; features_hash advisory if it self-features
{ …, "adapter": "custom_library",
  "custom_library": {"library": "vendor_scorer.so", "symbol": "vendor.fmha_scorer",
                     "config": { … }} }                // symbol + typed config, never inline code
```

**On `static_order.order`.** The entries are *ordering criteria* (`priority`, then `id`), not a literal
list of UKD ids — the same deterministic arbitration
[RFC 0017 §5](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#5-matching-the-ueds-pattern-and-the-umds-criteria) defines. An explicit id list is a
reasonable future extension for pinning a known-good order; if one is supplied, ids present in the list
rank first in the given order and **any catalog entry not named falls through to the default criteria**,
so a stale list degrades gracefully rather than hiding kernels.

### 4.1 Field Reference (normative)

The normative header. A loader can validate every row here without instantiating an adapter.

| Field | Required | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `version` | yes | string | `<major>.<minor>`, e.g. `1.0`. The compatibility field the accept rule gates on. A UHD carries no in-band type tag; the descriptor kind comes from the filename suffix (`<name>.uhd.json`), matching [RFC 0020 §4.2](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#42-normative-schema). |
| `id` | yes | GUID | Descriptor identity; what a UED heuristic role references. |
| `name` | yes | string | Human-readable; appears in the selection trace. |
| `adapter` | yes | enum | Ranking mechanism, and the **key of the body object** ([Section 7](#7-model-adapters)). |
| `features_signature` | if the adapter features | ordered list | Model inputs, in training order ([Section 6.2](#62-the-features_signature)). |
| `categorical_encoding` | if a feature reads a string field | field → (value → code) | Generated during training; makes string→number conversion explicit ([Section 6.5](#65-categorical-encoding)). |
| `features_hash` | if `features_signature` | `sha256:` + 16 hex | Fingerprint of the **resolved feature contract** — the canonicalized signature *and* `categorical_encoding`, truncated to 64 bits ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)). |
| `trained_against` | if the adapter features | descriptor refs, or `selector_revision` | What this heuristic was generated against: the `{id, revision}` **content revisions** of the `ued`, `kmd`, and every `umd`, or — for an engine that has no descriptor set — the opaque provider revision whose behaviour was measured ([Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling)). |
| `objective` | if the adapter scores | `max` \| `min` | Direction of the winning score, applied when the ranking is ordered. An adapter returns its model's raw value; the sign is the consumer's to apply, so a `min` model needs no trainer-side negation ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)). |
| `score` | no | object | `metric`, `calibrated`, and a `transform` drawn from the closed invertible set — lets a consumer recover the metric's value in its registered units ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics), [Section 11.3](#113-cross-engine-comparison)). `metric` names a registered ranking metric and fixes the units and the winning direction, so `objective` must agree with it. A `calibrated` score requires a `metric`. |
| `<adapter>` | yes | object | Adapter-scoped body; its key **must** equal `adapter`. A body naming a model file may also carry that file's `hash` ([Section 7.2](#72-default-tree_data)). |
| `x-…`, `_…` | no | any | Author-reserved extension namespaces, ignored by the loader ([Section 4.1](#41-field-reference-normative)). |

Two header rules govern the split:

- **The body key MUST equal the `adapter` value.** One discriminant selects one body, with no ambiguity
  about which schema applies. A document carrying a body for an adapter it does not name is a load error, not a
  silently ignored field.
- **The loader validates the header; the adapter validates the body.** A UHD naming an adapter the
  provider does not implement produces a diagnosable "unsupported adapter" error rather than a parse
  failure, so a newer pack landing next to an older provider degrades predictably.

Each `major.minor` is a standalone JSON Schema **file** in the repository; the inline copy below
mirrors the authoritative `uhd/1.0.json`, and a CI check verifies the match. The schema targets
**Draft 7**, matching [RFC 0020 §4.2](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#42-normative-schema), so one
file drives both the build-time and runtime checks.

**The schema enforces the header rules; it does not merely accompany them.** Three of them are worth
naming, because each needs an explicit construct rather than falling out of the document shape:

- **Exactly one body, and it is the named one.** `additionalProperties: false` is not what delivers
  this. That keyword rejects *undeclared* property names, and every adapter body is declared — a
  `native` descriptor carrying an `onnx` body alongside it uses only names the schema knows, so the
  keyword has nothing to object to. Exclusivity comes from the second block of conditionals: each body,
  *if present*, constrains `adapter` to its own name. Paired with the first block (each `adapter` value
  requires its body), the discriminant and the body imply each other in both directions, and a second
  body of any kind is unsatisfiable.
- **A body is required, including `static_order`'s.** The body is a required member for every adapter
  ([Section 4.1](#41-field-reference-normative)), so `static_order` is conditioned like the rest rather
  than left as the one adapter whose absent body validates.
- **The scoring and training fields are conditioned, and their subfields are reachable.** A model
  adapter requires `objective`, the feature contract, and `trained_against`. `trained_against` in turn
  admits exactly two shapes — all three descriptor entries, or a `selector_revision` — through an
  `anyOf` paired with `dependencies` that make partial descriptor provenance unsatisfiable. Each
  descriptor entry requires both `id` and `revision`. An empty `trained_against`, a `umd` scalar, a
  `umd` entry with no revision, and a document claiming one descriptor's revision while omitting the
  others are all rejected at the point they would otherwise pass as "present". An empty `umd` **array**
  is accepted, because it is a claim rather than an omission
  ([Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling)).
- **Direction is the metric's, not the author's.** A `score` naming a `metric` requires the
  `objective` that metric's registry entry fixes ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)) — `max` for
  `tflops`, `min` for `time` — and a `calibrated` score must name its metric. The pairing is checked
  here rather than discovered when an engine's estimate sorts backwards
  ([Section 11.3](#113-cross-engine-comparison)). The `metric` enum and these conditionals are generated
  from the registry, one conditional per metric, so adding a metric adds a row rather than a hand edit.
- **`transform` is a closed, invertible vocabulary.** A consumer recovering real TFLOPS has to invert
  whatever the trainer applied, so the set is the one the runtime can invert rather than free text. An
  unrecognised transform is refused at load rather than silently treated as `identity`.

**Extension keys are reserved, everywhere.** Any member whose name begins with `x-` or `_` is accepted
and ignored, at the document root and inside every nested object, as is a top-level `provenance` block.
This is not a relaxation of the closed-schema rule but the mechanism that makes it affordable: authors
and build systems need somewhere to record their own metadata, and without a reserved namespace they
record it in fields the loader does read. A genuinely unknown name — one matching no declared property
and neither reserved prefix — is still a hard rejection.

The principle behind all of it: **a producer validating against the published schema must not be able to
emit a descriptor the prose requires a loader to reject.** Where the two could diverge, the schema is
the side that gets tightened.

**Validated against shipping descriptors.** The schema above accepts every `version: "1.0"` UHD in the
tree — `native` selectors, `tree_data` catalog rankers, and `tree_data` engine estimates, with and
without `categorical_encoding`, under both provenance forms — and rejects each malformed shape the
header rules describe: a missing or duplicated adapter body, a model adapter with no `objective` or
`trained_against`, an empty or partial `trained_against`, a mixture of the two provenance forms, a
scalar `umd`, a `umd` entry carrying no revision, an unrecognised transform, a calibrated score naming
no metric, an `objective` that contradicts its metric's direction, and an untruncated digest. Descriptors at earlier versions, such as the `0.1`
packaging-test fixtures with placeholder ids, are rejected by the `version` constraint, which is the
accept rule working as intended rather than a gap. The shipping descriptors predate `score.metric` and
spell the same fact `score.units: "tflops"`; they migrate to `metric` with the implementation of
[Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics), in one cutover rather than behind an accepted alias, and this
validation claim is re-established against the migrated tree.

**OPEN — remaining schema work.** The block above covers the header and the adapter bodies as they exist
today. Still outstanding: publishing it as the standalone per-version `uhd/1.0.json` file with the CI
parity check RFC 0020 §4.2 describes, and extending it as each further adapter lands, so validation is
generated rather than hand-written. *(See [Open Question 13](#operational).)*

### 4.2 Adapter Summary

`adapter` is a **single discriminant** — it subsumes [RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md)'s
illustrative `kind` + `model.framework` into one field (`tree_data` ≈ `kind:model, framework:lightgbm`
shipped as data), and the body is an adapter-keyed union. Adding a new ranker (a static list, ONNX, a
new model family) is one more `adapter` value — the single discriminant is what makes that additive.

| `adapter` | What it is | Ranking | Model artifact |
|-----------|------------|---------|----------------|
| `static_order` | A fixed precedence with no learned model | Declared criteria / UKD `priority` | none |
| `native` | A scorer compiled into the engine, resolved by symbol name — **first to land** | Whatever the function returns | none (code, not data) |
| `table` | A bucketed lookup over quantized feature ranges, carried as a FlatBuffer | Quantize the row, look up the bucket, then tie-break | with engine |
| `tree_data` | A GBDT tree table (LightGBM/XGBoost), in-tree walker — **default shipping path** | Score each candidate, argmax | with engine |
| `onnx` | An ONNX graph via a gated runtime | Score each candidate, argmax | with engine |
| `custom_library` | An author-shipped `.so` behind a small C ABI (drop-in escape hatch) | Whatever the library returns | with engine |

See [Section 7](#7-model-adapters) for adapter details.

**The model ships as data with the engine, not linked into the provider.** For every *data* adapter, the
body's `artifact` is a path resolved relative to the engine's descriptor set (the UED + its UHD + KMD +
model), which is itself standalone-droppable. The model is per-engine (owned by the UED), so there is
no `(arch,dtype)→artifact` table — the single arch-aware model serves every pack that joins the engine.
The `native` adapter is the deliberate exception: it names a symbol the engine already compiled in, so it
is *not* droppable — which is exactly why it is the bootstrap path and not the destination
([Section 7.1](#71-first-native)).

**OPEN — regressor vs. ranker.** The tooling trains a *regressor* on TFLOPS and argmaxes. A
learning-to-rank objective (LambdaRank/NDCG) optimizes ordering directly and may pick better *within*
an engine without needing calibrated absolute values. But a calibrated TFLOPS regressor is what makes
the **absolute, cross-comparable metric** of [Section 11.3](#113-cross-engine-comparison) possible; a
pure ranker forecloses that and leaves only the rank-ordering fallback. The regressor preserves the
absolute option, keeping ranking as the fallback rather than the only mode; this is the recommended
default. Decide per-UHD via `objective` / `score`, or standardize. See [Open Question 1](#schema-and-training).

### 4.3 Future: `predict_applicable_kernels`, When There Is No Catalog to Rank

`sort_kernel_catalog` assumes a **finite, enumerable catalog** — the engine's AOT-compiled kernels that
pass the matchers. It scores those candidates and picks a winner. That holds for every AOT case and is
what this RFC specifies in full.

**JIT breaks the assumption.** When kernels are generated rather than pre-compiled, the candidate space
is the *combinatorial product of the knobs* — tile sizes × warp layout × pipeline × padding × … — which
can be far too large to enumerate, let alone score one candidate at a time. In that regime there may be
**no catalog to rank at all**, so "score every candidate and argmax" has nothing to iterate over.

This is the role the UED reserves as **`predict_applicable_kernels`**
([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)): a first-stage heuristic reduces the intractable knob space
to a small, plausible candidate set — generating or bounding it rather than filtering an existing list —
and `sort_kernel_catalog` then does the usual predicted-TFLOPS ranking over that set. The second stage
reuses everything in this RFC (adapters, `features_signature`, computed features, the contract checks);
what differs is the first stage's **output contract**.

**The schema already has the slot; the role is what's deferred.** Because the UED names its heuristics as
three independently-optional, role-scoped fields rather than one id, standing up
`predict_applicable_kernels` later is not a schema change — the field is specified now and simply left
unset until the JIT path is real. What is *not* settled, and is deferred to
[Open Question 8](#structural):

- **The stage's output contract.** Emitting candidate configurations that do not yet exist is not
  ranking; it produces new KMD tuples and feeds the build path, which is closer to catalog *synthesis*
  ([Section 14](#14-package-creation-time-selection-knobs-and-aot-kernels)) than to selection. Whether
  that output belongs in a UHD at all, or in the package-creation tooling, is the open question.
- **Where it runs.** `predict_applicable_kernels` runs *during* the applicability query — it answers
  "what could this engine build for this graph?" — which is the single case that breaks the "UHD runs
  strictly after applicability" rule of [Section 10](#10-applicability-flow). That rule is a property of
  the AOT v1 pipeline, not an invariant, and this role is the anticipated exception.

### 4.4 Ranking Metrics

A score is only comparable with another score in the same quantity. Throughput is the quantity engine
selection has used so far, but a caller may equally want the fastest wall time or the most accurate
result, and an engine may ship a model for each. The **ranking metric** is what `score.metric` names: the
quantity a UHD's score estimates, and therefore the key by which a request selects a UHD
([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships), [Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric)).

**The metrics are a closed registry, owned by hipDNN.** The backend orders engines by these numbers, so
it has to know each metric's direction and units; a free-text name would leave it guessing. The registry
lives beside the policy names in the data SDK, and each entry fixes three things:

| Metric | Units | Better | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tflops` | TFLOPS (10^12 FLOP/s, FLOPs taken from the binding layer) | higher | Defined. The default metric, and the only one before this section. |
| `time` | milliseconds of device time for one execution | lower | Defined. Trained on `avgTimeMs` directly, not derived from throughput. |
| `accuracy.*` | per definition | per definition | **Reserved.** Each accuracy metric names its definition, e.g. `accuracy.max_rel_error`; none is registered until its reference and tolerance are settled ([Open Question 20](#ranking-metrics)). |

- **The metric fixes units and direction; the UHD only names it.** `objective` must equal the registered
  direction and `score.transform` must invert back into the registered units
  ([Section 4.1](#41-field-reference-normative)). There is no per-UHD unit conversion: two models of the
  same metric are comparable by construction or are rejected at load.
- **Adding a metric is a registry row, not an ABI change.** Requests and predictions carry the metric by
  name ([Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric)); a name the backend's registry does not know is
  refused where the request is made, not discovered while sorting.
- **Metrics do not substitute for one another.** A request for `time` is never answered by a `tflops`
  model, even where one could be converted into the other for a fixed graph: the conversion would be
  the runtime inventing a number no model predicted. An engine with no model for the requested metric
  is *unscored* for that request ([Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007)).
- **`tflops` is the default.** A request that names no metric behaves exactly as engine selection did
  before metrics existed.

**Only a calibrated score takes part in cross-engine comparison.** A metric value is compared across
engines, and across the two levels of [Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker),
only when the UHD declares `calibrated: true`. An uncalibrated model may still rank its own catalog under
a metric — a `time` ranker trained as a ranker orders kernels by expected time without predicting a
comparable number — but it answers no prediction and is invisible to engine selection.

---

## 5. Selection Flow

The generic engine first builds the **catalog**: the set of the engine's kernels that pass every matcher
for this graph ([RFC 0017 §5](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#5-matching-the-ueds-pattern-and-the-umds-criteria)), each carrying
its build `metadata`. The catalog is engine-scoped — the union across every KDP that joins the engine —
and the engine owns the UHD that ranks it, so the candidates and their selector arrive together.

Kernels joining one engine are mutually substitutable for the graphs they co-match (same op family), and
the model is trained to rank exactly that catalog. Kernel selection then proceeds:

1. **Start from the catalog.** The applicable kernels for this graph are the candidate set.
2. **Extract the shared features once.** Problem and device features are identical for every candidate,
   so they are computed once per graph ([Section 6](#6-feature-extraction)); only each candidate's
   `$kernel.*` metadata varies.
3. **Score each candidate.** Invoke the UHD's scorer per candidate — for a model adapter, one inference
   call per candidate over its feature row.
4. **Choose by objective.** `max` (or `min`) over the scores; the winner is the selected kernel.
5. **Tie-break deterministically.** On equal scores — or when no model ranks at all (steps 6 and 8) —
   fall through to explicit UKD `priority`, then stable `id` — the same deterministic arbitration
   [RFC 0017 §5](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#5-matching-the-ueds-pattern-and-the-umds-criteria) defines. Declaration order
   is never used.
6. **A UHD is optional.** An engine that names no heuristic is valid; it is the starting state
   ([Section 13.1](#131-two-stage-workflow)). The catalog is returned in deterministic
   `priority`-then-`id` order and a **warning** is logged once, naming the engine. No authoring is
   required for a working engine; generating a heuristic is a later step the package owner opts into.

   > "Unranked" is `priority`-then-`id` order, never *discovery* order. Descriptor sets are loaded by
   > scanning a directory, so discovery order varies by filesystem and would rank a package differently
   > on two machines. `priority`-then-`id` is stable across runs, load orders, and machines.

7. **A kernel that will not build is skipped; a malformed descriptor is not.** Selection returns a
   ranked catalog, and the caller walks it: if the top-ranked kernel cannot be built into a plan — its
   code object will not load, its workspace query fails — the next candidate is tried, and so on. Ranking
   answers *which kernel is fastest*, not *which kernel exists on this machine*, so a kernel that cannot
   be built costs only itself while a sibling still serves the graph.

   The one exception is a **malformed descriptor**, which is rethrown rather than skipped. Falling past an
   authoring error would hide the fault and silently serve a different kernel than the one authored, so
   the two cases are distinguished deliberately: a kernel that does not fit this machine is skipped
   quietly, and a descriptor that is wrong is loud.

   This is a build-time walk, not a runtime retry. Once a plan is built and executing, there is **no
   fallback to the runner-up**: an execution failure surfaces to the caller rather than silently
   re-dispatching, because a kernel that reached execution was already judged applicable, and quietly
   substituting another would mask the applicability defect that let it through.

8. **A broken *heuristic* degrades the result; it never fails the request.** This rule is about the
   heuristic specifically, and it differs from step 7 deliberately. Ranking is optional — an engine with
   no usable model still has a valid answer in `priority`-then-`id` order — so a heuristic that cannot be
   trusted is switched off rather than raised. A malformed *kernel or dispatch* descriptor has no such
   fallback: nothing else can build that plan, and substituting a different kernel silently would serve
   something other than what was authored, which is why step 7 rethrows it. **What is optional degrades;
   what is required raises.** Each heuristic failure mode resolves to a usable answer plus a diagnostic:
   - **No model, or the scorer errors** → rank by `static_order` (priority + id). No ranking information
     is available, and priority order is a valid answer. A benchmark record, where one exists, is
     consulted ahead of both ([step 9](#5-selection-flow)): a degraded model does not degrade a
     measurement.
   - **Broken feature contract** — `features_hash` disagrees, a `$kernel.*` reference is dangling, or the
     KMD pairing is incompatible ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)) → the model is not used (its
     inputs are not the ones it was trained on, so its scores would be wrong), an **error** is logged,
     ranking falls back to `static_order`, and the engine reports its estimate as *invalid* so any
     engine with a real estimate outranks it in engine selection. The engine still answers, still
     dispatches, and loses on merit rather than by exception.

   A contract mismatch is a **CI gate**, not only a log line: descriptor-set validation runs over shipped
   packs in CI and fails the build there rather than degrading silently in the field
   ([Section 12](#12-observability), [Open Question 14](#operational)).

   **Scorer failure is model-global, and is decided over the full applicable catalog.** The fallback in
   the first bullet switches the whole ranking rather than one entry, so where it is evaluated is part of
   the contract. A scorer error is resolved against the **canonical candidate set** — every kernel the
   matchers admitted for this graph, before any knob filter narrows it — and disables the model for that
   request and for the lifetime of the ranking it caches ([Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching)). Knob
   filtering then applies to the resulting order.

   Fixing the basis this way is what keeps filtering and ranking commutative
   ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)). A per-subset decision would
   not: if scoring fails on one candidate, ranking the full catalog first would fall back for everything,
   while a knob pin that happened to exclude that candidate would score normally, and the two paths would
   disagree on the winner from the same inputs. The cached ranked order is the full catalog's
   ([Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching)) and would disagree with a freshly ranked subset in exactly
   the same way. Evaluating the model's usability once, over the whole catalog, leaves both paths
   starting from the same basis; `static_order` is itself per-candidate — `priority` then stable `id` —
   so a fallback order restricts to any subset unchanged.

9. **A measurement outranks an estimate.** The two order sources above — the model, then
   `static_order` — are both predictions about which kernel is fastest. When the provider already holds
   a benchmark record that covers this graph on this device, it holds the answer those predictions were
   approximating, and the ranked order is taken from the record rather than from the model.

   This is not a third opinion competing with the other two; it is the ground truth they estimate. A
   model earns its place precisely where no measurement exists, which is the overwhelming majority of
   graphs a shipped engine sees. Where one does exist, preferring the estimate would be choosing a
   prediction of a number over the number.

   Three conditions make it safe, and each mirrors a rule already stated above:

   - **Coverage is decided over the full applicable catalog, before any knob filter**, exactly as
     scorer failure is in step 8. A record that covers only part of the catalog does not order it; the
     model does, and the partial record is ignored rather than mixed in. Deciding coverage per filtered
     subset would let a pinned and an unpinned request take different order sources over the same
     candidates, which is the failure the commuting property exists to prevent.
   - **The record is keyed by what would invalidate it** — the graph, the device, and the engine's
     descriptor-set version ([Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching)). A measurement describes the
     kernels that were installed when it was taken, so a changed engine version does not merely age the
     record, it makes it a measurement of something else. Keying on the version is what makes that
     judgement automatic rather than a comparison a reader has to remember to perform.
   - **The store is capacity-bounded and evicts**, in memory and on disk
     ([Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching)). A measured order that never expires is a cache that
     eventually describes a machine the process is no longer running on.

   **The engine's figure of merit follows the order source.** Engine selection reads the top of the
   ranked list as the engine's estimate ([Section 11](#11-engine-selection-integration)). When a record
   ordered the catalog, the engine reports the **measured** value of that top candidate in the requested
   metric ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)) — the measured time, or the throughput derived from it —
   in the same units a calibrated model would have reported; a measurement and an estimate are
   comparable because they are the same quantity, obtained differently. A metric the record does not
   measure (accuracy, for a timing record) is answered by the model, not by the record. An engine with a
   record therefore competes on evidence rather than on prediction, which is the outcome this rule
   exists to produce.

**The output is the ranked catalog, not just a winner.** Selection returns the candidates in score order;
the winner is simply its first element. Callers need the ordering, not only the argmax — a knob query
reports the top-ranked value as the default, autotune walks the ranked list, and engine selection reads
the top score as the engine's figure of merit. Whatever ranks the list — model or fallback — the order
must be **deterministic run-to-run**, which is why every fallback path terminates in `priority` then
stable `id` rather than an arbitrary order.

**Applicability is the matcher's, not the scorer's.** A scorer expresses preference through its score and
nothing else; there is no sentinel value meaning "never pick this." A candidate that must not run is
excluded by a matcher before it reaches the catalog, and a candidate the model merely dislikes ranks last
on its score, which needs no separate mechanism. Overloading the score channel with an applicability
verdict — MIOpen's convention of a NaN score sorted last, with all-NaN an error — would put a correctness
claim in a performance number, and would reintroduce the failure mode step 8 exists to prevent: a catalog
that is non-empty yet has nothing selectable. The one genuinely different case, a candidate whose feature
values fall outside what the model was trained on, is a **confidence** question rather than an
applicability one and is handled as out-of-distribution input
([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)). **OPEN:** whether that check is applied per candidate
rather than per model — see [Open Question 16](#operational).

The winner is a single UKD, which then dispatches through its pack's UDD
([RFC 0017 §6](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#6-dispatch-and-workspace)). A UHD only ranks; it never
launches, mutates the graph, or touches device memory.

---

## 6. Feature Extraction

The feature vector is the contract between training and inference. It is the most failure-prone part of
the design, and generalizing it is the central problem this RFC addresses.

### 6.1 Feature Sources

A feature row is assembled from three sources, all available at plan time. All are drawn from the symbol
table the **engine's pattern publishes**: the UED carries a `nodes` block, and matching it binds every
tensor, dim, stride, and attribute the pattern names
([RFC 0020 §6](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#6-symbol-binding-what-the-pattern-publishes)). The UHD's
`features_signature` is one of that table's consumers, alongside UMD criteria and UDD dispatch formulas,
so matching, launch, and selection read one binding.

| Source | Namespace | Examples | Scope |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Problem** | pattern variables (`$q`, `$k`), `$graph.*`, `$<node>.*` | `$q.dims[2]`, `$q.dtype`, `$graph.node_count` | Shared across candidates |
| **Device** | `$device.*` | `$device.cu_count`, `$device.lds_size` | Shared across candidates |
| **Kernel** | `$kernel.*` | `$kernel.tile_m`, `$kernel.split_k` | Per-candidate (from UKD `metadata`) |

Computed features are not a fourth source. Quantization, ratios, and intensity are expressions over those
same three, written inline in the `features_signature`; there is no `$derived.*` namespace and no
named-value block ([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)).

**Reading a value is not the same as exposing it as a knob.** One problem value can serve several
consumers at once: a batch size is a feature the UHD ranks on (`$q.dims[0]`), a criterion a UMD gates on,
and an argument the UDD passes to the kernel — the same bound symbol, read three times. None of that makes
it a knob. Knobs are drawn only from **KMD fields**, the engine's kernel-variant space
([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)), and a problem or device value is
neither settable by a caller nor a property of a kernel. The converse also holds: the KMD carries fields
that are not knobs — dispatch detail a UDD consumes, or values a matcher gates on — so `knobs ⊆ KMD
fields` in one direction and `UHD features ⊄ knobs` in the other.

**Dims are positional, not named.** A bound tensor exposes each dim as `$q.dims[i]` and each stride as
`$q.strides[i]`, plus the derived facts `$q.rank`, `$q.dtype`, `$q.stride_order`, and `$q.packed`. Sizes
that read like attributes are dims: for a rank-4 SDPA tensor laid out as
`(batch, heads, sequence, head_dim)`, batch is `$q.dims[0]`, head count `$q.dims[1]`, sequence length
`$q.dims[2]`, and head size `$q.dims[3]`. A node's `$<node>.*` namespace carries **scalar attributes**
only — `$sdpa_fwd.dropout_probability` and the like — so a signature that reads a size reads a dim.

> **Implementation note — the bound set is op-specific.** Which tensors a pattern binds, and what each
> dim index means, differ per operation; the engine is op-scoped, so its UHD's references are valid for
> that op by construction. The extractor evaluates whatever the signature names, and the engine's
> published symbol set is the authority on what exists
> ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)).

Device features come from the same device-facts path [RFC 0007 §6](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md#6-device-properties)
defines. Kernel features are the compilation knobs the engine's KMD declares
([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)); these distinguish candidates
and are what make argmax meaningful.

**The graph namespace carries whole-graph facts and indexed node access.** `$graph.node_count` and
`$graph.tensor_count` describe the shape of the graph itself; `$graph.flops` and per-node
`$graph.nodes[i].flops` carry the op-intrinsic work counts a physics feature divides
([Section 13.6](#136-auto-deriving-a-first-pass-features_signature)). A node's tensors are reachable
positionally through the same namespace, so a signature can read a shape without the engine's pattern
having named that tensor as a top-level variable. The two spellings coexist deliberately: a pattern
variable is the readable form for an engine whose pattern names its tensors, and indexed node access is
what an engine reaching across a multi-node graph has.

**Two `$kernel.*` entries are not KMD fields.** `$kernel.priority` is bound, because a kernel's declared
priority is a fact about the candidate that a model may legitimately weigh. `$kernel.id` is not bound: a
kernel id is a UUID, and a feature splitting on its bytes would be ranking by authoring accident. The id
already decides ties ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)), which is the only role it should have in an order.

> **Implementation note — `$device.*` fields.** The device namespace publishes what the HIP runtime
> resolves and what proves predictive for kernel selection: `cu_count`, `multi_processor_count`,
> `warp_size`, `lds_size`, `total_global_mem`, `memory_bus_width`, `memory_clock_rate`, and
> `peak_memory_bandwidth`. The set is closed at any moment and extended additively; a field is published
> in the unit the runtime reports it in rather than a rescaled one, and `peak_memory_bandwidth` is the
> one derived entry, computed from the clock and bus width so a model need not rebuild it inline.
> **Architecture is not among them for an AOT engine:** `arch` is a KDP property gated at selection
> ([Section 3.3](#33-coupling-rules)), and per-arch model choice is the UED's arch-keyed heuristic maps
> ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)), so a `features_signature` does not read `$device.arch`.
> Architecture coverage is checked against the model's own training provenance instead
> ([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)).

### 6.2 The `features_signature`

The feature contract is the UHD's inline `features_signature` — an ordered list of model inputs, bound
the same way a UDD's `args_signature` binds kernel arguments. Each entry is either a direct field (a
bare `$`-prefixed reference) or an expression over those fields, written as a `{"op": [args]}` tree.
Order and form must match training exactly.

```jsonc
"features_signature": [
  // --- direct fields ---
  "$q.dims[2]",                                    // sequence length (positional dim)
  "$q.dims[3]",                                    // head size (positional dim)
  "$device.cu_count",                              // device property
  "$kernel.tile_m",                                // KMD field (per-candidate)

  // --- computed features, evaluated by the shared interpreter ---
  {"log2": ["$q.dims[2]"]},
  {"/": ["$q.dims[2]", "$k.dims[2]"]},                           // aspect ratio
  {"ceil_div": ["$q.dims[2]", "$kernel.tile_m"]},                // tile quantization
  {"/": ["$sdpa_fwd.flops", "$sdpa_fwd.bytes"]}                  // arithmetic intensity (Section 13.6)
]
```

**The expression language is the descriptor expression language**, shared with UMD criteria
(boolean-rooted) and UDD dispatch formulas (value-rooted), over the same symbol table; one parser,
validator, and interpreter serve all three. A feature entry is value-rooted like a dispatch formula.

The language is specified in its own RFC and is not restated here. It is JsonLogic-like but simpler —
most visibly, variable references are bare `$`-prefixed strings rather than JsonLogic's `{"var": …}`
wrapper, resolved through the engine's binding. Any JSON string beginning with `$` is a reference; every
other JSON scalar is a literal. No external JsonLogic specification is normative for this RFC.
**OPEN:** the expression-language RFC is deferred, so its section references cannot be cited yet; see
[Open Question 15](#operational).

The `features_signature` is a third consumer of that same language, alongside UMD criteria
(boolean-valued) and UDD dispatch formulas (value-valued); a feature entry is value-valued like a
dispatch formula. One parser, validator, and interpreter serve all three.

The operator set covers the computed features required here; no extension is needed:

> `and or !` · `== != < <= > >=` · `in` · `all` · `+ - * / %` · `divisible value_or_default` ·
> `present not_present` · `if` · `ceil_div min max abs pow log2 rsqrt`

`present` and `not_present` test whether a binding exists at all, which a comparison cannot: a signature
that must tolerate an optional tensor needs to distinguish "absent" from "zero" before it computes with
the value. They pair with `value_or_default`, which supplies the value once absence has been handled.

`shape` and `rank` are part of the written language but not of the evaluator: both are resolved when the
signature is compiled, into the positional `dims[i]` and `rank` bindings
([Section 6.1](#61-feature-sources)). A shape is known once the graph is bound, so recomputing it per
candidate would be work with a constant answer.

Log-scale sizes, aspect ratios, tile/wave quantization, and intensity are all expressible with this set.
Evaluation is a bounded interpreter: it fails closed on an unknown symbol, a type error, or an invalid
operation, and uses checked-width integers. A computation outside this closed set (for example a bespoke
occupancy model) uses a compiled scorer ([Section 7](#7-model-adapters)) rather than extending the
interpreter.

**Implementation status.** The shared implementation provides the arithmetic and comparison operators
this RFC's features need (`+ - * /`, `min`, `max`, `ceil_div`, `abs`, `pow`, `log2`, `rsqrt`,
`value_or_default`, `if`) as a compile-once / evaluate-many `Expression<DataT>` over any
`getData(path) → Value` source, which is the shape the feature extractor requires
([Section 9](#9-performance)). Two caveats carry into this RFC:

- **`shape` is a compiler short-hand, not a runtime op**; the compiler lowers it at compile time. A
  feature spec treats `shape`/`rank`-style helpers as lowered forms rather than runtime operators.
- **The custom-operation (native-predicate) hook is deferred.** Until it lands, a UHD needing a
  computation outside the closed operator set has no in-language path; that is the boundary at which a
  compiled scorer ([Section 7](#7-model-adapters)) takes over.

**The engine's published symbols are the feature source.** The `features_signature` draws its problem
features from the symbol table the engine's pattern binds, plus `$device.*` and the candidate's
`$kernel.*` ([Section 6.1](#61-feature-sources)). One binding pass feeds matching, dispatch, and
selection, with no parallel feature-extraction path.

Because the pattern is engine-wide and singular, the UHD — which is itself engine-wide — has an
engine-level binding to resolve against, and every token it names is declared before it is read. A
reference the engine's pattern does not publish is a **load error** at build and at drop-in load, not a
runtime decline ([RFC 0020 §6](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#6-symbol-binding-what-the-pattern-publishes)).
The UHD is validated against that published set exactly as a pack's UMD and UDD are, which is what makes
the [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement) contract check mechanical rather than per-pack.

**Derived features commonly needed:**

- **Arithmetic / algorithmic intensity** (FLOPs ÷ bytes) — the single most important derived feature
  for predicting compute-bound vs. memory-bound behavior.
- **Tile/wave quantization** — `num_tiles_*`, `total_output_tiles`, `tile_efficiency` (problem-vs-grid
  remainder waste). In GEMM sweeps this family is as predictive as intensity.
- **Aspect ratios** — `M/N`, `M/K`, `N/K` (shape skew).
- **Occupancy proxy** — `lds_usage_ratio` (and register pressure if available) → waves/CU.
- **Padding-fit** — `needs_padding_*` / `has_padding_when_needed_*` (problem × kernel padding interaction).

**OPEN:** See [Open Question 4](#schema-and-training) (derived feature set).

### 6.3 Contract Enforcement

The tooling code-generates the C++ featurizer to guarantee training and inference vectors are identical.
This RFC keeps that principle but makes the `features_signature` the single source of truth for both sides:

- **Inference:** A generic feature extractor walks the signature against the bound-variable table and
  device facts, producing the row in declared order. A generic extractor is preferred over code-gen
  because the sources are declarative and finite, requiring no per-op C++. Code-gen remains an option for
  a hot path.
- **Training:** The same signature drives the offline featurizer, so dataset columns match the runtime
  row by construction.

A four-part, model-agnostic contract check replaces the tooling's bare feature-count guard, and
generalizes to any ranker (LightGBM, ONNX, a custom scorer):

1. **Signature → published symbols.** Every non-`$kernel.*` reference the `features_signature` names —
   pattern variables and their `dims[i]`/`strides[i]`/derived facts, `$graph.*`, `$<node>.*`, and
   `$device.*` — must resolve against the symbol set the engine's pattern publishes
   ([RFC 0020 §6](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#6-symbol-binding-what-the-pattern-publishes)). An
   unresolvable reference is a load error at build and at drop-in load, with both descriptors named. The
   UHD is checked against the same published set as the engine's UMDs and UDDs, so one publisher serves
   all three consumers.

   **This check requires the declarative arm.** It reads the published set the `graph_match.nodes`
   pattern lays out at compile from the op-schema registry. Two cases fall outside it, both as
   [RFC 0020](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md) specifies:
   - **The `native` arm** ([RFC 0020 §4.5](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#45-the-native-arm-normative)).
     The tokens are whatever the registered function returns on a live graph, so the published set is
     unknown at load and this validation cannot run — for a UHD exactly as for a UMD or UDD. A stale
     reference fails at match time rather than being an error at load; for a UHD that is the
     [Section 5](#5-selection-flow) step 8 path (model not used, error logged, `static_order`). Checks
     2–4 still apply in full. RFC 0020 records this as a limitation of the hatch, which is why the
     declarative arm is the format's steady state.
   - **No `graph_match` at all.** The engine publishes an empty table, so a `features_signature` may
     reference only `$kernel.*` and `$device.*`. A model needing problem features requires the engine to
     declare a pattern.

   This bears on sequencing: the engines shipping first use the native arm, so the load-time guarantee
   arrives with the declarative pattern rather than with the first shipped model.
2. **Signature → KMD → knobs.** Two assertions over the same set. Let `F` be the `$kernel.*` fields
   reachable from the `features_signature`, including those nested inside computed (expression) entries:
   - `F ⊆ KMD.fields` — a feature can never read a variant field the kernels don't carry.
   - `F ⊆ set(UED.knobs)` — every axis the model ranks on is a knob the engine exposes
     ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)).

   **The second assertion is one-directional, and deliberately so.** A model ranking on an axis the UED
   never exposed is a **load error**: selection would depend on something the caller has no way to vary,
   which is a dial hidden behind a result. The converse is legal and expected. `UED.knobs` is the
   engine's public tuning surface — its UMDs read it, and so do callers who pin — so a training run has
   no standing to shrink it. A knob whose training column carried a single value cannot separate
   candidates, so feature selection drops it from the signature while the engine goes on declaring it.
   That case is **reported, never fatal**: an unread dial is worth surfacing so the engine's author can
   decide whether it still earns its place, and that decision is theirs rather than the trainer's.

   The UED owns the KMD and the UHD, so this is an intra-engine check the pipeline enforces when it
   emits the engine and the loader re-checks — catching a UED and UHD regenerated out of step, or
   hand-edited.
3. **Signature → model.** The UHD carries `features_hash`; the model artifact embeds the hash it was
   trained against (tree-table metadata, ONNX `metadata_props`, or a sidecar). At load the checker
   **recomputes the digest from the feature contract it actually loaded** and requires a three-way
   identity:

   ```
   hash(canonical(features_signature, categorical_encoding))
       == UHD.features_hash
       == model.trained_hash
   ```

   This check works for every model adapter because it fingerprints the *input contract*, not the model
   internals.

   **Recomputing is the whole check; comparing the two stored digests is not.** A model is a function
   over a vector, and a vector is positions, not names — the artifact knows that column 3 splits at 64,
   never that column 3 *is* `tile_m`. Transposing two `features_signature` entries, or editing one code
   in `categorical_encoding`, therefore rewrites what every affected column means while leaving both
   stored digests untouched. Every other check in this list survives that edit: check 1 resolves the
   same symbols, check 2 compares *sets* and cannot see order, check 4 counts the same number of
   columns. Only a digest taken over the loaded contract detects it, which is why the stored values are
   compared against a recomputed one rather than against each other.

   `features_hash` covers the signature and the categorical encoding. Because computed features are
   written inline rather than referenced by name ([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)), the signature is
   the computation, so hashing it fingerprints what each feature means rather than only what it is called.
   A named `$derived.*` layer would lack this property: editing a named expression changes a feature's
   meaning while every signature string stays byte-identical, and the hash would have to substitute the
   definitions back in to detect the change. The categorical encoding is folded in for the same reason,
   as [Section 6.5](#65-categorical-encoding) changes value semantics without changing feature names.

   **The canonical form is normative and shared.** `canonical()` serializes the signature compactly,
   in the order written, with object keys in a fixed order and numbers and strings in a fixed
   representation, so that whitespace and key order do not produce spurious mismatches. The categorical
   encoding is appended under a separator when the descriptor carries one, and omitted entirely when it
   does not — so adding an empty encoding to a descriptor is not a contract change. The digest is
   truncated to its leading 64 bits: the threat is a stale or mis-paired contract, not a forged one, and
   64 bits is far past the point where accidental collision is a plausible failure while keeping the
   field short enough to read in a diagnostic. Generation stamps `features_hash` and the artifact's
   `trained_hash` with the same routine the loader verifies with
   ([Section 13.4](#134-new-stage-package-stage-p)); a producer and consumer that disagree on the
   canonical form would turn every load into a false mismatch, so the routine has one definition and
   both sides call it.
4. **Vector → input.** Each adapter verifies its artifact accepts the resolved vector: `tree_data`
   checks feature count, `onnx` checks input arity/shape.

A failed check disables the model rather than failing the request. These run at load, so a violation
means a mis-built or mismatched descriptor set, and the model's scores would be wrong rather than missing.
The response is the one [Section 5](#5-selection-flow) step 8 defines: the model is not used, an error is
logged, ranking falls back to `static_order`, and the engine reports its estimate as *invalid*. Because
descriptor sets are drop-in and may be third-party, the loader handles this without taking down the
provider and without failing after the engine has claimed applicability. The error is logged and gated in
CI ([Open Question 14](#operational)); excluding the malformed engine from selection entirely is a
defensible stricter alternative, but failing the request is not. `features_hash` is optional for
feature-less adapters (`static_order`, and `native` when it self-features) and advisory for a
`custom_library` that self-features.

**Feature-vector portability.** This RFC specifies a per-model spec over a shared source vocabulary: the
spec is per-model, because models differ, but every spec draws from one fixed, versioned source
vocabulary and one extractor, so there is a single implementation to trust. Configurability comes from
which fields a signature selects and what expressions it builds over them — extensible without being
open-ended, because the set of extractable fields is fixed.

### 6.4 Computed Features

Many of the features a model ranks on are not raw fields but **computed** ones: tile/wave quantization
(`ceil_div($q.dims[2], $kernel.tile_m0)`), aspect ratios, arithmetic intensity, occupancy proxies. These
are written inline in the `features_signature`, as expressions over the three sources
([Section 6.2](#62-the-features_signature)). There is no separate namespace and no named-value block: a
computed feature is an entry that is an expression rather than a bare `$` token.

Computed features are inline rather than named because a named `$derived.*` layer would add a second
binding mechanism, a second thing to version, and a second place a feature's meaning could live, for
benefits the compiler supplies instead:

- **Repetition has no runtime cost.** Computed features layer: `total_tiles` is the product of two tile
  counts, tile efficiency builds on both, so the same subexpression appears in several entries. The
  signature is compiled once at load into an expression tree
  ([Section 9.3](#93-efficient-evaluation-expressive-spec-fast-hot-path)), and the compiler hash-conses
  identical subtrees, evaluating each distinct one once per row. Common-subexpression elimination is the
  evaluator's responsibility, not the schema's.
- **Hoisting is automatic.** A subexpression referencing only `$kernel.*` is graph-independent and is
  cached per kernel; one referencing only `$q.*`/`$device.*` is invariant across candidates and belongs
  in the shared prefix. The compiler classifies each subtree by the namespaces it touches; the author
  does not partition them.
- **A single hash target.** The `features_signature` is the computation, so `features_hash` fingerprints
  it directly ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)). A named block would permit editing an expression
  to change a feature's meaning while every signature string stayed byte-identical — a silent divergence
  that does not arise when the expression is the entry.

The tradeoff is verbosity: a repeated subexpression is repeated textually, and a long signature is harder
to read than a set of named parts. Because the signature is normally generated
([Section 13.6](#136-auto-deriving-a-first-pass-features_signature)) rather than hand-written, this trades
author ergonomics, which tooling covers, for one fewer runtime mechanism.

The dim↔tile correspondence is engine-specific (the tile field names are the engine's), so it does not
belong on the shared op vocabulary. The FLOP and byte terms are op-intrinsic and belong there instead, as
precomputed fields the binding system provides for every op rather than anything the UHD declares
([Section 13.6](#136-auto-deriving-a-first-pass-features_signature)).

### 6.5 Categorical Encoding

A model consumes numbers, but a KMD field may be a **string** (`dtype`, a pipeline name), a **bool**, or
an **int list**. Turning those into feature values must be done identically at training and inference;
otherwise the model ranks on a different meaning than it learned, and `features_hash` does not catch it
because the signature text is unchanged. This is the same class of silent divergence the inline-expression
rule closes for computed features ([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)), and it requires the same
treatment.

The tooling generates the encoding while it gathers the data and ships it in the UHD. Training and runtime
run against the same KDP, so the set of values a field takes is observable during generation. The tool
records it as an explicit map and emits it alongside the model:

```jsonc
"categorical_encoding": {
  "$kernel.dtype":    {"fp32": 0, "fp16": 1, "bf16": 2, "fp8_e4m3": 3},
  "$kernel.pipeline": {"intrawave": 0, "interwave": 1}
}
```

The rules that make this correct:

- **Derived from observation, never implicit.** The encoding is not an ordinal by declaration order, a
  hash of the string, or the underlying enum value; each of those changes silently when a schema is
  edited or a pack is rebuilt. An explicit table is the only form that can be diffed and version-checked.
- **Covered by `features_hash`.** The encoding is part of the resolved feature contract, like the
  signature itself, so editing it invalidates the model's contract check rather than passing silently.
- **An unseen value at runtime is out-of-distribution, not an error.** A string the map does not contain
  means the catalog moved outside what the model was trained on: the
  [Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs) path (log, degrade), not a load failure. It is also the
  cheapest out-of-distribution signal available, being an exact lookup rather than a range check.
- **`bool` needs no table** (0/1). **Int lists have no scalar form**: a `features_signature` cannot
  reference an `INT_LIST` field directly and must reduce one through an inline expression (a length, an
  element, a comparison) so the reduction is explicit and hashed.

**Ordering.** Integer codes imply an order a tree model can split on (`dtype < 2`), which is meaningless
for an unordered category. Two mitigations apply, selectable per field: assign codes in a meaningful order
where one exists (dtype by byte width, so splits are interpretable), or one-hot the field where none
exists. Codes assigned by first-seen order are not acceptable. **OPEN:** whether to standardize per-field
ordering semantics — see [Open Question 17](#operational).

### 6.6 Example: Mapping the Current rocKE SDPA Features

> **Illustrative.** This maps the **existing** rocKE FMHA-forward feature engine
> (`FmhaFeatureEngine`, 69 features) onto this RFC's namespaces, to show the model in practice and to
> validate that a real, in-use feature set decomposes cleanly. It documents how rocKE sources each
> feature *today*; it does not prescribe the final set.

rocKE's featurizer takes two dicts — a **`problem`** (the graph/problem) and a **`kernel`** (the
compiled variant's config) — and emits a fixed 69-`double` row. Those two dicts map directly onto the
RFC's two per-plan sources: `problem` → `$q.* / $<node>.*`, `kernel` → `$kernel.*` (the KMD fields).
Everything else is either `$device.*` (hardware) or an inline computation over those
([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)). The full decomposition:

**Problem — `$q.*` / `$<node>.*` (from the `problem` dict) — 8 raw + 7 log + 4 derived-shape**

| rocKE feature | RFC mapping |
|---|---|
| `batch, seqlen_q, seqlen_k, nhead_q, nhead_k, hdim_q, hdim_v` | `$q.dims[0]`, `$q.dims[2]`, `$k.dims[2]`, `$q.dims[1]`, `$k.dims[1]`, `$q.dims[3]`, `$v.dims[3]` |
| `dtype_enc` | `$q.dtype` (encoded) |
| `log2_batch … log2_hdim_v` (7) | computed: `{"log2": ["$q.<dim>"]}` |
| `gqa_ratio` = nhead_q/nhead_k | `{"/": ["$q.dims[1]", "$k.dims[1]"]}` |
| `aspect_sq_sk` = seqlen_q/seqlen_k | `{"/": ["$q.dims[2]", "$k.dims[2]"]}` |
| `log2_ops` | `{"log2": ["$sdpa_fwd.flops"]}` |
| `decode_flag` = (seqlen_q ≤ 1) | `{"<=": ["$q.dims[2]", 1]}` |

**Kernel — `$kernel.*` (from the `kernel` dict = KMD fields) — 20**

| rocKE feature | RFC mapping |
|---|---|
| `pipeline_code` | `$kernel.pipeline` (encoded) |
| `tile_m0, tile_n0, tile_k0, tile_n1, tile_k1, tile_k0max` | `$kernel.tile_m0 …` — the tiling of attention's two GEMMs |
| `pad_s, pad_sk, pad_d, pad_dv` | `$kernel.pad_*` |
| `num_warps` | `$kernel.num_warps` |
| `mask, bias, lse, dropout, logits, sink, skip, qscale, paged` | `$kernel.*` — **kernel capability flags** (whether the compiled variant supports that feature); note these are sourced from the `kernel` dict, i.e. they are build config, not problem attributes |

**Computed inline — the quantization / fit / occupancy families**

| rocKE feature | RFC inline expression (schematic) |
|---|---|
| `arithmetic_intensity` | `ops / mem`, where `ops = 2·batch·nhead_q·seqlen_q·seqlen_k·(hdim_q+hdim_v)` and `mem` sums Q/K/V/O bytes — the `{"/": ["$sdpa_fwd.flops", "$sdpa_fwd.bytes"]}` of [Section 13.6](#136-auto-deriving-a-first-pass-features_signature) |
| `num_tiles_m` = ⌈seqlen_q/tile_m0⌉ | `{"ceil_div": ["$q.dims[2]", "$kernel.tile_m0"]}` |
| `num_tiles_k` = ⌈seqlen_k/tile_n0⌉ | `{"ceil_div": ["$k.dims[2]", "$kernel.tile_n0"]}` |
| `total_tiles` = batch·nhead_q·num_tiles_m·num_tiles_k | product of the above with `$q.*` |
| `tile_eff_sq, tile_eff_sk, overall_tile_efficiency` | remainder-based tile-efficiency ratios |
| `cu_utilization` = total_tiles/num_cus | `total_tiles` expression ÷ `$device.cu_count` — spans computed × device |
| `tile_volume, tile_area` | products of `$kernel.tile_*` (graph-independent — cacheable per kernel) |
| `lds_usage_estimate` | `(tile_m0·tile_k0 + tile_n0·tile_k0)·dtype_bytes` |
| `lds_usage_ratio` | `lds_usage_estimate` expression ÷ `$device.lds_size` |
| `ratio_d_to_tk0, ratio_dv_to_tn1` | `$kernel` ratios (hdim vs. tile) |
| `sq_le_tm0, sk_le_tn0, d_eq_dv, gqa_flag` | boolean fit/shape flags |
| `total_q_elems, total_kv_elems` | element-count products |

**Device — `$device.*` — 8**

`hw_num_cus, hw_simds_per_cu, hw_total_simds, hw_shader_engines, hw_max_clock_mhz, hw_wavefront_size,
hw_lds_capacity, hw_num_xcd` → `$device.cu_count`, `$device.simds_per_cu`, … (from the device-facts path
of [Section 6.1](#61-feature-sources)).

*(`feature_count` is a bookkeeping constant, not a real feature.)*

**What this validates:**

- The 69 features partition exactly into the published namespaces — **no feature falls outside** the
  engine's bound tensors, `$kernel.*`, and `$device.*`, whether read raw or computed over. The published
  vocabulary is sufficient for a real model.
- Every rocKE "problem" quantity resolves to a **positional dim** of a bound tensor, not a node attribute
  ([Section 6.1](#61-feature-sources)): `batch`, `nhead_q`, `seqlen_q`, and `hdim_q` are `$q.dims[0..3]`,
  and `seqlen_k` / `nhead_k` are `$k.dims[2]` / `$k.dims[1]`. `dtype_enc` is the derived fact `$q.dtype`,
  encoded per [Section 6.5](#65-categorical-encoding).
- The split is roughly **~20 problem, ~20 kernel, ~20 computed, ~8 device** — about 30% of the vector is
  expressions rather than raw fields, which is the load the expression language carries
  ([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)).
- rocKE's `mask/bias/lse/…` are **kernel capability flags** sourced from the kernel config, so they are
  `$kernel.*` (KMD fields) rather than problem attributes, even though the problem also has a mask. The
  KMD field records whether the compiled variant supports masking, which is what the model ranks on;
  problem-side mask presence is a matcher concern.
- `arithmetic_intensity` here is the **problem/ideal** intensity (identical across all candidates for a
  graph) — a shared-prefix context feature, not a per-candidate discriminator; the algorithm-level
  differences are carried by the `$kernel.*` tile fields and the quantization derivations, exactly as
  [Section 13.6](#136-auto-deriving-a-first-pass-features_signature) describes.

## 7. Model Adapters

The question "LightGBM, CSV, or a separate library?" is really about how model content reaches the
scorer, and it maps onto [RFC 0017 §9](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#9-adapters-and-extensibility)'s
adapter model. A UHD names an `adapter`; the adapter turns content into a scorer. Adding a new ranker
is one more adapter value. Adapters come in the same two delivery classes as kernel-source adapters.

**Design constraint:** The model travels as data with the engine, not linked into the provider. The
engine's descriptor set (UED + UHD + KMD + model) must be a standalone drop-in next to an already-shipped
provider, exactly like the planned `hsaco` drop-in path for code objects (today authored `hsaco` is packed at build time and ships as `kpack`). This rules out statically linking the model
as the shipping mechanism — the model must be loadable data the running provider reads. The constraint is
on *linkage*, not compilation: a model may be compiled (e.g. a Treelite `.so`) provided it ships as a
loadable artifact rather than baked into `libhipdnn_provider.so`.

| Adapter | Runtime dependency | Standalone drop-in? | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| *(none named)* | none | n/a | **A UHD is optional.** No heuristic → deterministic `priority`/`id` order plus a warning ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow) step 6) |
| `static_order` | none | Yes (always available) | The same behavior, stated explicitly rather than inferred. Not a scorer: it names ordering criteria, so it resolves to a comparator rather than to an adapter instance |
| `native` | none | **No — compiled into the engine** | Scorer function resolved by symbol name; the bootstrap path |
| `table` | none | Yes | Bucketed lookup over quantized feature ranges, carried as a FlatBuffer beside the descriptor |
| `tree_data` | none | **Yes — default shipping path** | GBDT tree table + in-tree walker |
| `onnx` | ONNX runtime | Yes, if dep present | Opt-in, dependency-gated |
| `custom_library` | none on provider | Yes | Engine ships its own `.so`, `dlopen`'d through a tiny C ABI |

The ladder mirrors [RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md)'s native → data → escape-hatch
progression, and the landing order ([Section 15](#15-phased-delivery)) follows the cost of each stage:
`native` first, because it needs no new file format, parser, or extractor and proves the UHD seam with a
function; `tree_data` next, as the shipping path; `custom_library` last, because it requires a trust and
dependency audit.

### 7.1 First: `native`

> **Two unrelated uses of "native."** This is the UHD's `native` *adapter* — a compiled **scorer**.
> RFC 0020 § 4.5 defines a `graph_match` `native` *arm* — a compiled **matcher**. Different layers,
> different registries, and an engine may use either independently of the other.

The scorer is a function compiled into the engine and named in the UHD by symbol, resolved through the
same symbol-registration mechanism the ingestor uses for matchers and dispatch handlers. The UHD still
carries `objective` and `score`, so a native scorer participates in ranking and cross-engine comparison
identically to a model; the ranking seam is exercised end to end while the scorer behind it is ordinary
C++.

This is the simplest implementation and the fastest route to a working UHD, so it lands before the
data-driven adapters. It is **not** a drop-in: changing the heuristic requires recompiling the engine, so
it does not serve the data-driven, independently-shippable goal. It is scaffolding for the seam, an escape
hatch for heuristics no model expresses, and a baseline against which `tree_data` is measured.

`features_signature` is optional here: a native scorer may consume the standard feature row, holding it to
the same contract as a model, or featurize from the bindings directly.

### 7.2 Default: `tree_data`

The provider ships one generic GBDT tree-walker; the engine ships the model as a data artifact (a tree
table of feature indices, thresholds, and leaf values) that the walker reads. GBDT trees are inexpensive
to evaluate (on the order of a few hundred lines), and the tooling dumps the model to a walkable
structure. The adapter has zero runtime dependency, is fully standalone, and is verifier-gated; it is the
hsaco-equivalent for heuristics. Its one constraint: the provider must already support the model *family*
(a new family is a provider change).

**Artifact format.** A FlatBuffer carrying the ensemble, read through the generated accessors and
`Verifier`-gated before a single node is walked. Each tree is stored as **parallel per-node arrays** —
split feature index, threshold, left and right child, leaf value, missing-value direction, and
comparison sense — rather than as a node struct, so traversal walks contiguous memory and a leaf is
named by a negative child index rather than by a tag. The model carries `num_features`, the
`features_hash` its signature must match ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)), a base score, and
its training provenance ([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)). Prediction is the base score
plus the sum of the leaves reached; any shrinkage the trainer applied is already folded into the leaf
values and is never re-applied at inference.

**The verifier is necessary and not sufficient.** It proves the buffer is structurally readable — that
offsets and vector lengths are in bounds — and cannot prove anything that spans vectors. The adapter
therefore checks what the verifier structurally cannot before accepting a model: that the parallel
arrays agree in length, that every child index is in range, that every feature index is below
`num_features`, that thresholds and leaf values are finite, and that the child graph is **acyclic**. A
cycle in a tree is not a malformed buffer; it is a buffer that verifies cleanly and then does not
terminate.

**A model artifact may be content-addressed.** The body naming the artifact may also carry the digest
of its bytes, which the adapter recomputes before parsing and refuses on mismatch. `features_hash`
fingerprints the model's *input contract*; this fingerprints the *model*, and the two answer different
questions — a retrained model over an unchanged signature has the same feature hash and different
content. The size a model may occupy is bounded before any of it is parsed, so a malformed or hostile
length cannot be turned into an allocation.

### 7.3 Escape Hatch: `custom_library`

For a model the in-tree walker does not cover, the engine ships its own compiled scorer as a loadable
library, resolved through the platform's own dynamic loader on every supported host rather than through
a POSIX-only path, and called through a small C ABI (`score(const double* feats, size_t n) -> double`).
That ABI is deliberately the same one a `native` scorer implements, so a single scorer implementation
serves either delivery route and moving between them is a packaging decision rather than a rewrite.
Treelite generates such a library from a tree model. Any model family is supported, under the
author-native-code trust class of
[RFC 0017 §12](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#12-packaging-and-delivery).

The constraint is on linkage, not compilation. Compiling a model *into* the provider makes it
non-portable to third-party provider builds; a model may still be compiled (a Treelite `.so`) provided it
ships as a loadable artifact alongside the engine's descriptor set rather than statically linked into
`libhipdnn_provider.so`. `custom_library` mirrors
[RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md)'s native-predicate and custom-plan escape hatches: the
author ships a `.so`, the provider `dlopen`s it. **OPEN:** See [Open Question 11](#operational)
(dependency + trust audit).

`custom_library` and `native` both run compiled code; they differ in who ships it and when. `native` is a
symbol already inside the engine binary — no loading, no ABI boundary, no trust question, and no
independent shipping. `custom_library` is an author-supplied `.so` the provider `dlopen`s, which restores
drop-in delivery at the cost of the dependency and trust questions [Open Question 11](#operational)
covers. They sit at opposite ends of the same tradeoff, which is why `native` lands first and
`custom_library` last.

### 7.4 Initial Support

The initial adapters are **`static_order`, then `native`, then `tree_data`**. `static_order` is trivial
and always available; `native` proves the seam with a compiled function and needs no new format;
`tree_data` is the data-driven shipping path. `table` is a low-cost addition for coarse bucketed
heuristics. `onnx` and `custom_library` are added when a concrete need appears, the latter gated on the
trust audit.

## 8. Versioning and Compatibility

### 8.1 Descriptor Versions and UHD Coupling

Because the UED co-owns the KMD and UHD, a KMD change may invalidate the trained model. The obligation is
conditional, matching [RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md) (see
[Section 3.3](#33-coupling-rules)):

- **Additive change (new field, or new legal values on a field):** no retrain is required until the
  change is exposed to selection. The old feature space is still valid, so the existing model keeps
  ranking correctly. A field added purely for the UDD (dispatch/launch geometry) does not affect the UHD,
  since `UHD features ⊆ KMD fields`.
  - *Caveat:* dropping in a KDP whose kernels vary along a field the model was **exposed to but not
    trained across** can degrade ranking, because the model ranks on values it never saw. This is a
    training-coverage gap, not a schema break; the fix is a retrain, not a load failure.
- **Breaking change (remove or reinterpret an existing field's values):** the retrain must land in the
  same change. A removed or reinterpreted field the model still references is caught at load.

In one sentence: **a KMD change that alters the UHD's feature space or value domain forces a retrain;
additive dispatch-only fields do not.**

That is the compatibility floor, not the recommendation. An additive change can also admit **new
candidates** or widen applicability, and a model that never saw them ranks a catalog it was not trained
on — legal by the rule above and still worse than it should be. The guidance is therefore simpler than
the rule: **regenerate the heuristic on any KMD change.** The rule says when a model must be replaced;
the guidance says when it is worth replacing.
- **Renaming a field:** treated as remove plus add — a breaking change on the old name.

Three descriptors can invalidate a heuristic, not one. The KMD defines the `$kernel.*` feature space; two
others change what a trained model reads:

| Descriptor | Why a change can invalidate the model |
|---|---|
| **KMD** | Defines the `$kernel.*` fields. Removing or reinterpreting one breaks the feature space directly. |
| **UED** | Two ways. Its `knobs` **are** the model's `$kernel.*` feature axes ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)), so a knob-set change and a model change are the same event. It also owns `graph_match`, which **publishes the symbol table** the features read ([RFC 0020 §6](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#6-symbol-binding-what-the-pattern-publishes)) — so a pattern change can alter what a bound token *means*. Engine identity and op scope changes land here too. |
| **UMD** | Narrows the catalog. A pack's criteria decide which kernels survive for a graph, so a matcher change alters the candidate set the model was trained to rank — invisible to a feature-name check. The UMD *reads* the binding; it does not produce it ([RFC 0018 §2](0018_UniversalMatchDescriptor.md#2-the-symbol-table-criteria-read)). |

The UHD records all three. What it records is each descriptor's **content revision**, which is a
different axis from the `version` field that governs file-format compatibility:

- **`version` answers "can this provider parse this file?"** It gates the accept rule each descriptor
  type defines for itself ([RFC 0020 §14.1](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#141-the-accept-rule)),
  where a major mismatch orphans the file outright — the runtime supports exactly one major at a time.
  It moves only when the file *grammar* moves: a field removed, renamed, retyped, made required, or
  given a new meaning.
- **`revision` answers "is this still the content the model was trained on?"** It moves when a
  descriptor's *values* move within an unchanged grammar — a KMD field dropped, a UED's `knobs` list
  rewritten by feature selection, a pack's criteria tightened.

Keeping the two apart is what makes a retrain shippable as data. Feature selection dropping `split_k`
rewrites an existing `knobs` array and leaves the JSON grammar byte-identical, so it is not a format
event. Stamping it as one would orphan that engine on every deployed provider of the current major, and
re-stamping providers to match would orphan every unrelated descriptor of the old major — one engine's
routine retrain becomes a fleet-wide migration, which is the opposite of the data-only update this
design exists to deliver. **A model update costs a revision, never a migration.**

`revision` is itself `<breaking>.<additive>`, mirroring the change classes above: the additive component
moves when a descriptor gains something a trained model can ignore, the breaking component when it
removes or reinterprets something a model may have read.

```jsonc
"trained_against": {
  "kmd": {"id": "5a1c0000-…", "revision": "2.4"},
  "ued": {"id": "7f30b911-…", "revision": "3.1"},
  "umd": [{"id": "1a7f52c8-…", "revision": "1.0"},   // one entry per matcher
          {"id": "be019c8c-…", "revision": "1.2"}]
}
```

Each entry names the descriptor as well as its revision. The id is what makes the check attributable:
a diagnostic can say *which* descriptor regressed rather than that something did, and a descriptor
present at load but absent from `trained_against` is distinguishable from one that merely moved.

**The UMD entry is a list because the dependency is plural.** A UHD is engine-scoped and many packs may
join one engine, so one `sort_kernel_catalog` ranks the union of their catalogs
([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)) and is trained against a *set* of independently revised matchers rather
than one. A scalar cannot express that set: recording the highest revision rejects every matcher below
it, recording the lowest lets any of the others regress unnoticed, and recording one leaves the rest
unchecked. A list of `{id, revision}` pairs checks each dependency against the matcher it belongs to. A
matcher loaded but absent from the list was not part of the training set and is reported as such — it
narrows a catalog the model never saw.

An empty `umd` list is meaningful rather than missing: it records that no matcher narrowed the catalog
the model was trained on. An engine whose packs carry no criteria is legal
([RFC 0020 §4.2](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#42-normative-schema)), and for one the honest
provenance is an empty set — distinct from omitting `umd`, which claims nothing about matchers at all
and is rejected.

**Provenance takes a second form, for an engine that has no descriptor set to be trained against.** A
model may be bound to an engine whose behaviour is not described by a UED, KMD, and UMDs — an engine
that wraps a vendor library, or one whose selection is compiled in and whose UHD is attached by a
provider-declared binding rather than by a role map. There is no descriptor revision to record, because
no descriptor decides what that engine does. What decides it is the provider build itself, so that is
what the model records:

```jsonc
"trained_against": {"selector_revision": "hip-kernel-provider/0.2.0/asm-sdpa-untuned-v1"}
```

`selector_revision` is an opaque string, compared for **exact equality** against the revision the
running provider reports. A model whose recorded string differs is not used; one that records no
provenance at all cannot be matched to any build and is refused the same way.

The two forms are exclusive and exhaustive: a `trained_against` carries either all three descriptor
entries or a `selector_revision`, never a mixture and never neither. Partial descriptor provenance is
the failure mode both forms exist to prevent — it would let a model claim a dependency on the one
descriptor that did not move.

The string is opaque **by construction, not by omission**. It names the thing whose behaviour was
measured, at the granularity at which that behaviour changes. A provider build hash is the wrong
granularity: it would expire every model on every commit to the repository, including commits that
cannot affect the engine in question, and no model could ever ship alongside the source that produced
it. The revision an engine reports moves when what it wraps moves, which is the event a retrain is
actually coupled to.

**Enforcement — the concrete rule.** At load, for every revision recorded in `trained_against`:

```
compatible  ⇔  trained_against.<d>.breaking == <d>.revision.breaking
           &&  trained_against.<d>.additive <= <d>.revision.additive
```

Breaking bump = disable the model. Additive bump = still compatible. A UHD newer than the descriptor it
names (`trained_against.additive > actual.additive`) is also incompatible — it may reference something
that descriptor does not yet declare, which catches a half-updated descriptor set. The check runs per
entry, so one regressed matcher disables the model on its own evidence without implicating the others.

This maps onto the change classes above exactly as intended:

| Descriptor change | `revision` bump | File-format `version` | Effect on an existing UHD |
|---|---|---|---|
| KMD adds a field, or adds legal values to one | **additive** | unchanged | Still compatible — `UHD.additive <= KMD.additive` holds. The model keeps ranking on the fields it knows. |
| KMD removes, renames, or reinterprets a field | **breaking** | unchanged | Incompatible — the model is disabled until retrained and restamped. |
| UED **removes** a knob | **breaking** | unchanged | The engine withdrew a dial a caller could set. A model still reading it fails the [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement) containment check and is disabled; the removal is additionally a caller-visible API break, which is a release-policy obligation on the engine rather than a loader one. |
| UED **adds** a knob | **additive** | unchanged | The public surface grew. An existing model reads a subset of a larger set, which is the normal steady state, so no retrain is forced — though a knob no model ranks on is reported until one does. |
| A pack's criteria narrow or widen the catalog | **breaking** on that UMD | unchanged | The candidate set the model was trained to rank has changed, which no feature-name check can see. |
| A descriptor's JSON grammar changes | — | **major or minor**, per that type's own rule | Independent of any model. A UHD is not restamped for a grammar change that leaves content untouched. |

A mismatch is a contract violation and takes the [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement) path — the model
is disabled, an error is logged, ranking falls back to `static_order`; the request never fails. The same
applies to any `features_signature` reference to a field the KMD no longer declares. The trace surfaces a
training-coverage warning when the catalog spans a field value outside what the model was trained on
([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)).

### 8.2 Model Updates

Models ship as data artifacts, so a heuristic update is a file swap and a restart. The update
**replaces** the engine's descriptor set; it is not installed beside it:

1. Stage the new set (UED + UHD + model artifact) outside the directory the provider scans.
2. Swap it into place over the old set — atomically where the filesystem allows, so no scan can observe
   a half-written set — retaining the previous set outside the scanned inventory.
3. The provider loads the new descriptors on next initialization.
4. Rollback: swap the retained set back the same way.

No provider recompile is required.

**Why replacement rather than coexistence.** An updated engine keeps its identity — same UED `id`, same
`name` — and changes only which UHD its heuristic role references. Leaving the previous set discoverable
therefore hands the loader two UEDs that share an identity and differ in content, which is a collision
rather than a version choice:
[RFC 0020 §13.2.1](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#1321-duplicate-detection-descriptor-id-and-name)
unloads **all** participants in an `id` or `name` collision instead of keeping the first, because
descriptor load order is not deterministic. The content-identical exception does not apply, since the
heuristic reference is exactly what changed; and a fresh UED `id` does not evade it, because the two
still collide on `name` and the `name` invariant has no identical-content exception. An update dropped in
beside its predecessor removes the engine instead of improving it.

Rollback copies stay outside the scanned inventory for the same reason. Retaining a previous set on disk
is sound practice; retaining it where the loader can see it is a collision waiting for the next restart.

This is the restart-time path. Reloading a model into a running provider is a separate problem — the
model cache is a sibling of the heuristic on the engine and fixed for that engine's lifetime
([Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching)) — and is not specified here.

### 8.3 Out-of-Distribution Inputs

Unknown architecture is the visible case of a general problem: the model has expectations about the values
it was trained on, and nothing in the schema prevents it from being handed others. A new GPU arch, a
dropped-in pack whose kernels use tile sizes the sweep never covered, and an additive KMD field newly
exposed to selection all produce the same failure — the model returns a value, with confidence and no
basis for it. Tree models are especially prone, extrapolating by returning the leaf value of the nearest
region seen in training, which can be arbitrarily wrong for a distant input.

This is distinct from a contract violation: the contract holds, every field resolves, and the hash
matches. Only the values are new. Two approaches apply, with a real tradeoff:

- **(a) Accept it and manage it by versioning.** Treat out-of-distribution input as a known error class
  and prevent it procedurally: track which arches and value ranges a model was trained on, and require a
  retrain-and-republish when a pack or platform moves outside them. Zero runtime cost, but detection is
  entirely process discipline — nothing catches a violation in the field.
- **(b) Ship training-coverage metadata and check at runtime.** The model artifact carries the observed
  range (or value set) per feature; the loader compares the resolved row against it and downgrades to
  `static_order`, or keeps the model but flags the score as low-confidence, when a feature falls outside.
  Stronger detection, at the cost of per-evaluation checking latency and of publishing the training
  distribution inside a shipped artifact, which not every author will accept.

**Device drift within an architecture is accepted, not treated as out-of-distribution.** A model trained
on one SKU of a gfx target is used on every SKU of that target. `gcnArchName` does not distinguish them,
so the UED's arch-keyed maps resolve them to one UHD by construction
([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)), and a UHD per architecture-and-CU-count is not expressible
without a different keying mechanism. The resulting ranking is right, or occasionally slightly wrong, and
that is the intended trade: a suboptimal kernel rather than a wrong answer, against a combinatorial number
of models. The constraint this places on the `features_signature` — raw device values always, computed
features only where the sweep varied them — is enforced by the generation tool
([Section 13.5](#135-sweep-space-grid-vs-constraint)) rather than detected at load.

This RFC specifies **(a), with three exact-match exceptions.** All three are discrete lookups rather
than per-feature range checks, so they cost little and catch the highest-impact cases:

- **Arch** — the model artifact carries the set of architectures its training corpus covered, and the
  runtime compares the resolved device against it. This is a **loader-side** check against a resolved
  device fact, not a `features_signature` read: `arch` is a KDP property gated at selection and is not a
  token an AOT signature may reference ([Section 6.1](#61-feature-sources)). The GFX name is already
  resolved for the pack-level arch gate and for selecting the arch-keyed heuristic
  ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)), so it costs nothing additional. An unseen architecture
  withholds the engine estimate rather than supplying an unfounded one.
- **Categorical values** — a string outside the UHD's `categorical_encoding`
  ([Section 6.5](#65-categorical-encoding)) is an exact-lookup miss, and therefore free.
- **Score range** — a recovered score that is not finite and positive is not a usable prediction. Such a
  candidate is distrusted **individually**: it orders last and is reported as 0, while the rest of the
  ranking stands. One diagnostic per request carries the affected and total counts, so a model going
  wrong everywhere reads differently from one candidate falling off the end of its trained region.

Carrying the arch set in the artifact rather than in the descriptor is deliberate: it is a property of
the corpus a model was fitted to, not of the document that names the model, and keeping the two together
means a model cannot be re-pointed at a new architecture by editing JSON. The same artifact-side slot
keeps per-feature coverage metadata additive, so (b) remains available without a format break.

Where the degradation is not per-candidate, it is the [Section 5](#5-selection-flow) one: fall back to
`static_order`, log, and never fail. **OPEN:** See [Open Question 16](#operational).

## 9. Performance

Selection runs on the plan-build path, so its cost must be small and paid at most once per distinct need.

### 9.1 Dependencies

- **Zero new runtime dependency for the default path.** The `tree_data` adapter's evaluator is in-tree,
  so the default shipping path adds no runtime library. The provider cannot grow a hard `liblightgbm` link.
- **Build-time LightGBM is acceptable.** Training and tree-table conversion run offline in the pipeline
  ([Section 13](#13-model-generation-pipeline)), never in the shipped runtime.
- **A `custom_library` scorer `.so` carries its own inference** — no provider dependency; the engine
  owns whatever it linked (e.g. a Treelite-generated evaluator).
- **`liblightgbm` at runtime is opt-in only**, behind a `lightgbm_native` adapter, for environments
  that already have it. Never a default.
- **FlatBuffers / data-SDK are already in-tree** and are the natural carrier for the `features_signature`
  and any serialized model-table.

### 9.2 Loading and Caching

- **Load on demand, and never before applicability.** Two rules govern loading:
  1. The UHD is never consulted to decide applicability; that is the matcher's job
     ([Section 10](#10-applicability-flow)). No UHD is loaded, parsed, or evaluated until the engine has
     been found applicable for the graph.
  2. After that, it loads only when something asks for what it produces. There is no eager ranking and no
     speculative load. The demand triggers are a policy requesting an estimate in its ranking metric to rank
     engines, a **knob query** (the reported default is the UHD's top-ranked value,
     [Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)), and kernel selection. A
     policy that ranks by explicit user choice or fixed criteria asks for none of these and loads no UHD.

  Ranking can be triggered for an engine that goes on to lose — a policy may ask every applicable engine
  for an estimate before picking one — so the model must be cheap to load and cheap to rank with. A
  provider that never sees FMHA never parses the FMHA model, and a policy that never asks for estimates
  never parses any.
- **Model cache — per engine.** After first load the parsed model / tree table / native handle is cached
  **on the engine**, matching the mechanism in the kernel-ingestor foundation
  ([PR #10606](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/pull/10606)): lazily loaded, then held for the
  engine's lifetime. Since a UHD is owned by exactly one UED, an engine-scoped cache has no sharing to
  miss. It must not be **handle-scoped**: RFC 0017 moves caching off the handle, because a handle can be
  swapped between calls, rebound to another device, or destroyed while a plan
  built through it is still in use, so handle lifetime says nothing about cache validity. A
  provider-wide static cache only becomes interesting if UHDs are ever shared across engines, which the
  ownership model does not currently allow.
- **Result cache on the descriptor cache key.** Selection is a pure function of (feature vector,
  candidate set). Reuse RFC 0017's applicability cache key — **`(engine id, graph id, device id)` plus
  the engine's descriptor-set version** — rather than a bespoke fingerprint. "Engine id" here is the
  **64-bit id** hipDNN keys on (the FNV-1a hash of the UED `name`), not the descriptor GUID;
  [RFC 0020 §3](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md) keeps those two id spaces distinct. The device id
  because it is what `$device.*` resolved against, and the version so a pack that changed cannot be
  served an order computed over the kernels it used to contain. Where the cache already lives **on the
  engine** — as it does in the ingestor foundation — the engine id is *implicit* in the cache's location
  rather than absent from the key. In practice this is the **catalog cache** that foundation maintains:
  the ranked order rides along with the catalog it ranks rather than living in a second structure.

  **Why a version rather than a process-local generation counter.** An earlier draft keyed on an
  inventory counter bumped on re-scan. Descriptors are scanned when hipDNN initialises and not again, so
  in a running process that counter is a constant and the only invalidation it can express is one that
  never happens. The descriptor-set version says the same thing durably: it distinguishes two builds of
  an engine rather than two scans of one, which is the distinction that actually matters both in memory
  and — unlike a counter — across a restart. Should in-process re-scan ever land, a re-scan that changes
  nothing leaves the version alone, which is the correct answer for a cache.

  **What is cached is the full applicable catalog's order**, which is why no knob filter appears in the
  key. A pin narrows the candidate set but not the ranking: a filtered request restricts the cached
  order rather than producing its own, which is the commuting property ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)
  step 8) doing the work that a per-filter cache key would otherwise have to. Adding the pinned settings
  to the key would multiply entries by the knob cross-product to store orders that are already
  derivable.

- **In-memory: the metric is in the key; the UHD beyond it is not.** A heuristic can be replaced independently of the
  kernels it ranks ([Section 8.2](#82-model-updates)), which raises the obvious worry that a cached
  ranking outlives the model that produced it. In process, it cannot: the cache is a sibling of the
  heuristics on the engine, all fixed for that engine's lifetime, so **a swap means new descriptors,
  a new engine, and a new empty cache.** What the location does not identify is *which* of the engine's
  rankers produced an order, because an engine holds one per metric
  ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)); so the **ranking metric** is part of the key, and a
  `time` request is never served an order computed for `tflops`. Given the metric, the UHD's identity is
  implicit in the cache's *location*, exactly as the engine id is. Should hipDNN ever re-scan
  descriptors in-process without rebuilding engines, the **descriptor-set version** already in the key
  covers that case too — a re-scan that brings a new UHD brings a new version with it.

- **Persistent: the UHD identity has to be in the path, because nothing else survives a restart.** The
  moment rankings outlive the process, the argument above evaporates — generation counters are
  process-local, and a restart happily reads entries written by a model that has since been replaced.
  The natural layout is a **directory per heuristic build**, with the same `(graph, device)` entry key
  inside it:

  ```
  <cache root>/<uhd id>/<uhd content hash>/<graph id>-<device>.rank
  ```

  Three details decide whether this actually works:
  - **Hash the content, don't trust the id or a version field.** A regenerated model normally keeps the
    same UHD id — it is the same logical heuristic for the engine — and a hand-maintained version can be
    forgotten. Hash the UHD document *and* the model artifact together. `features_hash` is not a
    substitute: it fingerprints the input contract, not the weights, so two models with identical
    features and different training both hash the same.
  - **Do not key the device on the HIP ordinal.** Device 0 is a different GPU on a different machine, and
    can be a different GPU after a reboot. Persisted entries need a stable device identity — arch name
    plus the `$device.*` facts the model actually consumed.
  - **Store kernel ids, not kernel definitions.** The ranked order is a list of UKD ids, re-resolved
    against the loaded descriptors on read. Persisting whole definitions duplicates descriptor state that
    can drift out from under the cache.

  The result is that invalidation becomes deleting a directory: a new model writes a new hash directory,
  the old one is unreachable and can be reaped by age, and no entry-by-entry staleness check is ever
  needed.

  **Worth measuring before building.** Ranking is a few hundred comparisons per candidate; the genuinely
  expensive work on this path is kernel compilation and matcher evaluation. A persistent cache for the
  *ranking* alone may not repay its complexity — the case for it is much stronger if it rides along with
  a persistent applicability or compiled-kernel cache. See [Open Question 9](#operational).

- **Two limits on caching.** [Section 9](#9-performance) states that selection cost is paid at most
  once per distinct need. Two conditions bound that guarantee:
  - **The cache is capacity-bounded** (an LRU in the current foundation), so a working set larger than
    the bound re-ranks on eviction. The bound is a tuning parameter, not a correctness issue, but the
    latency budget should be justified against the *uncached* path.
  - **Some graphs cannot be cached at all.** The key needs a stable graph identity; a graph that is
    unfinalized, legacy, or carries a non-v4 id has none, so **every call re-ranks**. That is the real
    worst case for selection overhead, and it is the one [Section 9.4](#94-latency-target) should be
    measured against.

  **OPEN:** in-process only vs. a persistent cross-run cache — see [Open Question 9](#operational).

### 9.3 Efficient Evaluation (Expressive Spec, Fast Hot Path)

Extensibility lives in the data contract; efficiency lives in a compiled core. The seam is the adapter,
and the extensibility cost is paid once per candidate (one indirect call), not per feature:

**Scoring is inherently per-candidate**, because `$kernel.*` features differ per candidate — that is what
makes argmax meaningful in the first place. So the goal is not to avoid the per-candidate loop but to
make each iteration as small as possible:

- **Lower the `features_signature` at load, never walk the expression tree per candidate.** The UMD PoC
  already compiles a rule to an `Expression<DataT>` once
  ([Section 6](#6-feature-extraction));
  the feature extractor reuses that so per-candidate scoring is a tight loop over a compiled expression
  and a flat tree table — no strings, no JSON, no map lookups.
- **Split the row into a shared prefix + per-candidate suffix.** Problem and device features
  (`$q.*`, `$device.*`) are identical across every candidate in the engine; only `$kernel.*` and the
  computed subexpressions that depend on it vary. Compute the invariant prefix **once per graph** and refill
  only the varying slots per candidate, turning O(N × full-featurize) into O(full-featurize + N × small)
  for N candidates. The kernel-dependent tail is the part that cannot be hoisted or cached across
  candidates, and keeping it small is the main lever on selection cost.
- **Reuse the engine's bound symbols; do not re-extract.** Matching the engine's pattern binds the
  problem tokens once per graph, and selection reads that table rather than re-featurizing
  ([Section 6.1](#61-feature-sources)). The scorer receives the bound symbol table alongside the
  candidate, so a heuristic never walks the raw graph — a second extraction path is what the single
  binding exists to prevent. Because the pattern is engine-wide, the binding is shared by every pack
  joining the engine and is computed once, not once per matcher.
- **Single-candidate short-circuit.** If only one UKD survives matching, skip the model and return it —
  common, and it makes the load-on-ranking case above nearly free.

### 9.4 Latency Target

The `native` adapter is the performance floor (a direct call, near-zero inference cost) and — because it
lands first ([Section 7.1](#71-first-native)) — it doubles as the measured baseline every later adapter
is compared against. The `tree_data` walker is expected to be close: a flat tree table over a
preallocated feature row is a few hundred comparisons per candidate. Target: overhead within 2× of the
`native` baseline.

**This needs measuring, not asserting.** Selection sits on the plan-build path and runs once per
candidate, so CPU overhead is the thing most likely to make a data-driven heuristic unshippable. The
components should be **wall-clocked separately** — descriptor load and model parse, feature extraction
(shared prefix vs. per-candidate tail), and scoring — so a regression is attributable and so the cost of
different adapters can be compared directly when choosing between heuristic options. The exact budget is
not fixed here; the requirement is that the numbers exist and are tracked, per
[RFC 0017 §14.1](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#141-testing-and-performance).

---

## 10. Applicability Flow

The two selection levels ([Section 2](#2-scope)) are not cleanly sequential; the part that interleaves is
the **matcher**, not the UHD. This distinction bounds when a model may be loaded.

**Applicability comes from the matcher, and it bubbles up.** Engine selection cannot rank engines it has
not ruled out. For a descriptor engine, "do I apply?" is the **matcher (UMD) pass** at the descriptor
layer, which uses no heuristic; that result bubbles up so non-viable engines are ruled out before the
first plugin-policy layer ranks the survivors.

**The UHD runs strictly after that, and only when asked.** Ranking is not part of deciding applicability
and is never performed speculatively. It happens when a caller needs something only the ranked catalog
can answer — an estimated throughput for a policy, a knob default, or the selected kernel:

```
Graph
  └─► Matcher pass (per engine)          ← no UHD involved
        └─► Applicable engines
              └─► Policy ranking          ← may request estimates ─┐
                    └─► Winner                                     │ on demand only
                          └─► Kernel selection ────────────────────┴─► UHD ranks the catalog
```

So there is no flow in which ranking happens before applicability is confirmed, and none in which it
happens without a request. Whether a UHD is loaded at all depends on the policy in play: one that ranks
by explicit user selection or fixed criteria never asks, and never triggers a load. The load-timing
rules, the per-engine model cache, and the shared `(engine id, graph id, device id)` +
generation-counter result key are specified once in [Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching) and are not
restated here.

**Where estimates fit.** Once the policy has its applicable set, it *may* ask each engine for a
predicted performance and order them by merit rather than by a static list. Today rocKE's `isApplicable`
is a yes/no gate; what changes is that a separate, subsequent query can return a score. The gate stays
free; the score costs a model evaluation and is only paid when a policy wants it.

## 11. Engine Selection Integration

This section describes how kernel-level heuristics feed engine-level selection. The policies themselves
are [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md)'s territory; this RFC supplies the heuristics
they consult.

### 11.1 The Engine Estimate and the Kernel-Catalog Ranker

Two of the engine's three UHD roles ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)) participate in
engine selection, both predicting an absolute value of a ranking metric
([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)) so they are comparable across engines:

| UED field | Signature | Cost | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|------|
| **`predict_engine`** (L1) | `f(graph) → expected metric value` | Cheap (no catalog enumeration) | Quick-policy engine ranking |
| **`sort_kernel_catalog`** (L2) | `f(graph) → best kernel + its metric value` | Full per-candidate | Kernel selection + accurate cross-engine score |

Each role holds at most one UHD per metric per architecture key, so an engine answers a request for a
given metric at L1, at L2, at both, or not at all; which levels answer is a property of that engine for
that metric ([Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric)).

`predict_engine` is the coarse proxy; `sort_kernel_catalog` both selects the kernel and yields the
better figure of merit. (The third role, `predict_applicable_kernels`, precedes both when present — it
produces the candidate set the ranker then sorts — but is not itself a performance estimate.)

**`predict_engine` is not needed for v1.** With a single descriptor engine there is nothing to
rank *against*, so the cheap estimate buys nothing — `sort_kernel_catalog`'s top score answers "how fast
would this engine be?" adequately. It becomes necessary when there are **competing engines** to order,
and for **opaque engines** that cannot expose a per-candidate catalog to rank at all.

**Distinct model and derived estimate serve different policies.** A distinct `predict_engine` model is
what gives the quick policy its value: it answers from the graph alone, so losers never enumerate
candidates. The ranker's top calibrated score is a second estimate of the same quantity, obtained by
enumerating the catalog; the thorough policy consults it first and falls back to the distinct model
([Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007)). The quick policy never substitutes it: an
engine with no L1 model for the requested metric is unscored under that policy rather than enumerated,
because paying the enumeration is exactly the cost the quick policy exists to avoid. The "cheap (no
catalog enumeration)" property belongs to the distinct model alone, and it holds only because that
model is trained on `f(graph)`.

**An estimate model may not read the catalog.** A UHD bound to `predict_engine` is refused if its
`features_signature` reaches any `$kernel.*` field, or if its `categorical_encoding` encodes one. The
role's whole value is answering before candidates are enumerated; a kernel feature would make that
impossible while leaving the descriptor superficially valid.

**An estimate must be comparable, not merely ordered.** Engine selection compares these numbers across
engines, so a UHD in this role is bound only when it declares a registered `metric`, `calibrated: true`,
the `objective` that metric fixes, and a transform this runtime can invert
([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics), [Section 11.3](#113-cross-engine-comparison)).
A within-engine ranker that happens to be accurate is not admissible here: its score orders one catalog
correctly and says nothing about another engine. The adapter set is correspondingly narrower than the
ranker's — an estimate is served by a compiled scorer or a trained model, not by a bucketed table, whose
resolution is chosen for separating candidates rather than for absolute accuracy.

**A model that binds is not the same as a model that answers.** Binding resolves, per metric, to one of
three outcomes, and consumers distinguish them: *available* (an estimate this request can use),
*unavailable* (the engine declares no estimate of this metric for this architecture — absence, ordered
by the static rules), and *invalid* (an estimate was declared and could not be trusted — the
distrusted claim of [Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007)). Collapsing the last
two loses exactly the distinction that section depends on.

**An estimate is attached by the engine, never claimed by the descriptor.** The engine, role, and
architecture a UHD serves come from the UED's role map; a document that names them itself is checked
against the binding it was resolved through and refused on disagreement. Otherwise a dropped-in
descriptor could attach itself to an engine that never referenced it.

### 11.2 Two Engine-Selection Policies (RFC 0007)

Shorthand in this section: **A** (L1) = the engine's `predict_engine` UHD for the requested metric, **B**
(L2) = its `sort_kernel_catalog` UHD for that metric
([Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker)). Every request names one
ranking metric, `tflops` when the caller names none ([Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric)), and
both policies compare engines only in that metric, ordered in its registered direction.

- **Quick policy (L1 only).** Rank applicable engines by A. An engine with no A for the metric is not
  scored — B is never evaluated under this policy, for any engine, because the policy's purpose is a
  fast answer and B's cost is a catalog enumeration per engine. Engines with no descriptor layer (e.g.
  MIOpen) contribute their A like any other engine and, if they win, use their own internal kernel
  selection. Whether the *winner's* configuration is then filled in from its B inside the policy, or left
  to plan build, is [Open Question 21](#ranking-metrics).
  **OPEN:** See [Open Question 7](#structural) (non-descriptor engine estimates).
- **Thorough policy (L2 first, then L1).** Run B for every applicable engine that has it (best
  configuration + its predicted value), fall back to A for engines that do not, then compare across
  engines and pick the global best (engine + configuration). More work, more accurate.

```
Quick:     applicable → A(metric) per engine → rank by metric → winner → dispatch (kernel chosen at plan build)
Thorough:  applicable → B(metric), else A(metric), per engine → rank by metric → best (engine, config) → dispatch
```

**Both estimates are exposed through the plugin API, per metric, and both are optional.** The query
surface carries A and B separately — they have different costs, and the quick policy's entire value is
being able to ask for A *without* paying for B. Neither is guaranteed to exist for a given metric: an
engine may have B but not A (the v1 case), A but not B (an opaque engine like MIOpen reporting a coarse
estimate), or neither. The policy therefore treats a missing estimate as a normal outcome rather than an
error:

| Engine has, for the requested metric | Quick policy | Thorough policy |
|---|---|---|
| A and B | Rank by A | Run B; compare its top score |
| B only | Unscored: static-order tail | Run B; compare its top score |
| A only (opaque) | Rank by A; engine does its own kernel selection | Compare A against others' B |
| Neither | Unscored: static-order tail | Same |

Scored engines sort first, by value in the metric's direction, with ties broken by the static order;
unscored engines follow in static order, named in one warning that also names the metric. **If no
engine is scored, the policy declines** — the next policy in the configured order runs, normally static
ordering — and says why: "no engine serves `<metric>` at L1" for the quick policy, "at L1 or L2" for
the thorough one. Declining rather than returning an all-unscored list keeps the trace honest: a list in
static order is not a ranking by the requested metric, and must not be reported as one.

**Mixing levels is sound only because both are calibrated.** The thorough policy may compare one
engine's A with another's B. That is admissible only because both are calibrated estimates of the same
registered metric, in the same units ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)); the policy records which
level answered for each engine, so a trace shows when a ranking crossed levels.

**A missing estimate and a distrusted one are different signals.** An engine that supplies no estimate
reports nothing and is ordered by the existing static rules. An engine whose heuristic failed its
contract ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow) step 8) reports the *invalid* outcome of
[Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker), which is a claim rather than a
silence — it says *do not pick me*, and the policy places it after every engine with a usable estimate.
It is not encoded as a value: "zero" is the worst throughput but the best time, so no single number
means *bad* in every metric. Absence means "I do not answer this question"; invalid means "I answer, and
the answer is not to be trusted."

An engine that supplies no estimate is ordered by the existing static rules and simply does not
participate in metric-based comparison — the mixed case has to work, since it is the near-term reality
for every non-descriptor engine.

### 11.3 Cross-Engine Comparison

**OPEN:** See [Open Question 1](#schema-and-training) (regressor vs. ranker).

Cross-engine arbitration is hipDNN's and the user's. RFC 0017 does not constrain a UHD's scores to its
own engine, which leaves room for a policy that compares engines on UHD-estimated throughput. RFC 0017
fixes that arbitration is exercised through three mechanisms: **explicit selection** of an engine,
**policy configuration** (a resolved sequence of heuristic-policy plugins supplying the ranked engine
list, where a policy may itself be a heuristic), and **auto-tuning**, which measures engines and picks the
winner outright ([RFC 0013](0013_Autotune.md)). The two policies of
[Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007) are policy configuration — new policies in
that existing slot, not a new arbitration surface. Auto-tuning remains the ground truth these heuristics
approximate, and the substrate that trains them ([Section 13](#13-model-generation-pipeline)).

The mechanism is an absolute, cross-comparable figure of merit. Candidates are scored cardinally, on an
absolute metric (calibrated TFLOPS by default, or another registered metric,
[Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)) rather than a within-group rank. When a UHD is a calibrated
regressor of a metric, its best-candidate score is a predicted figure of merit for what the engine would run,
expressed on a scale that means the same thing across engines. This lets each engine run its own heuristic
per package, independently, while the results remain comparable across engines: hipDNN compares engines by
predicted performance rather than a fixed order (for example, rocKE predicting 310 TFLOPS for its best
FMHA kernel against MIOpen's 240 selects rocKE). Local, per-package scoring composes into a global
comparison without a central ranker, and the UHD is where the number exists.

Absolute scoring is a harder problem than ranking. A per-package model need only be monotonic to pick
correctly among its own candidates; making it calibrated — accurate in absolute TFLOPS, so cross-engine
comparison is sound — is strictly harder. A miscalibrated absolute score is worse than a correct rank,
because it produces confident but wrong cross-engine picks.

**Fallback.** If the absolute method underperforms, engine selection degrades to rank-ordering at the
engine-policy level: it reverts to existing [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md)
static/rank ordering, and each UHD continues ranking within its engine without claiming a comparable
absolute score. Rank-ordering is the defined backstop; the design does not depend on calibration
succeeding.

**What this RFC commits to:** the UHD schema declares `score` (`metric`/`calibrated`/`transform`,
[Section 4](#4-uhd-schema)) so a consumer can invert the training transform and recover the metric's
value in its registered units; the metric registry ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)); metric-keyed
role maps ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)); and a score-only evaluation mode (rank and return
the best score without selecting for launch).

**What is deferred:** Delivering cross-engine comparison requires changes outside the UHD:

1. **A plugin-query surface** for the per-graph figure of merit — both the cheap **A** (engine
   estimate) and the accurate **B** (config UHD run in a "score only, don't launch" mode), each asked
   for one named metric ([Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric)). This is an engine-plugin ABI
   addition, owned by the plugin SDK, not this RFC; it must also let a non-descriptor engine (MIOpen)
   report an A-level estimate through the same surface, or the policy falls back to today's static
   ordering for it.
2. **The two engine-selection policies** that consume it ([Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007)) —
   the quick policy (rank by A only) and the thorough policy (B, else A, for every engine) — and the
   request surface that names the metric. Both are squarely
   [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md)'s territory.
3. **Cross-engine calibration.** Comparing estimates across engines only works if each model (A and B)
   is calibrated to the metric's real units (not just monotonic for argmax). This is a real modeling
   requirement, not just plumbing — and the one most likely to force the rank-ordering fallback if it
   does not hold up, separately for each metric.

This is a dedicated follow-up co-owned with [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md).

### 11.4 Selecting a UHD by Metric

A request names the metric it ranks by; everything between the request and the UHD that answers it
carries that name. This section fixes what each seam carries. The ABI and API spellings are the plugin
SDK's and [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md)'s to settle; what is normative here is
what must reach each seam.

**Request.** The engine-heuristic descriptor carries a **ranking metric** beside its policy order, set
by the caller, overridable by environment with the same precedence as the policy order (environment,
then attribute, then default), and defaulting to `tflops`. An unregistered name is rejected when it is
set. The per-engine and per-configuration prediction queries carry the metric the same way.

**Plugin query.** A prediction request names `(engine, kind, metric)`, where *kind* is A (engine) or B
(configuration). The engine answers from its UHD for that metric at that level, for the device's
architecture, or reports the metric unavailable; it never answers in a different metric. The answer
carries the **metric name and value** rather than a field named for one metric, and the host checks
that the returned metric is the requested one — a mismatch is *invalid*, not a conversion. Validity
of the value is the metric's: non-negative throughput, positive time.

**Capability query.** A caller can ask an engine which metrics it serves at which level, for the
current device, without evaluating any model: a list of `(kind, metric, UHD id)`. It reads bindings only,
so it is cheap, and it lets a caller fail fast — "no applicable engine serves `time` at L1" — before
paying for a ranking that would decline. The same answer drives the policy's decline reason in
[Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007).

**Kernel choice at plan build follows the metric.** A policy picks an engine, and under the thorough
policy also its configuration; but an engine that picks its own kernel at plan build ranks its catalog
with a `sort_kernel_catalog` UHD ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)). That ranking uses the UHD for the
request's metric when the engine has one, and the engine's default ranker
([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)) otherwise, recording which in the trace. The metric
therefore travels with the chosen engine configuration from the policy to plan build. Every cache of a
ranked order is keyed by metric as well as by model ([Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching)); otherwise
a `time` request could be served an order computed for `tflops`.

**Engines without a descriptor set** bind their L1 models in provider code
([Open Question 7](#structural)). That declaration becomes a list of UHD ids per architecture, like the
UED role map, and the metric of each comes from the UHD it names — never from the provider table.

---

## 12. Observability

Because selection is data-driven, it must be inspectable — consistent with
[RFC 0017 §10](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#10-observability-and-diagnostics) and
[RFC 0007 §12](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md#12-logging). The UHD path surfaces:

- **Selection trace:** Candidates, scores, the ranked order, winner, and whether the model or a fallback
  decided
- **Model provenance:** UHD id, adapter, model artifact version, `features_hash`,
  `trained_against` (UED/UMD/KMD content revisions, each named by id), training provenance
- **Contract diagnostics:** A clear **error** (not a warning) naming which of the three checks failed and
  why, plus the fact that ranking degraded to `static_order` and the estimate was reported as 0
- **Coverage warnings:** When a scored candidate or device falls outside what the model was trained on
  ([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs))

Logging alone is not sufficient. Because a broken contract degrades rather than fails
([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)), nothing at runtime stops a mis-built pack from shipping and
ranking by priority order. Descriptor-set validation therefore runs in **CI over shipped packs** —
checking hash agreement, KMD pairing, signature resolvability, and knob-tuple uniqueness — so the error
surfaces at build time. See [Open Question 14](#operational).

---

## 13. Model Generation Pipeline

The UHD is only useful if producing one is automated — by tooling any package author can run, not a
provider-specific service.

### 13.1 Two-Stage Workflow

1. **Ship a working pack with no heuristic.** The UED names no UHD. The catalog comes back in
   deterministic `priority`/`id` order with a warning that the engine has no heuristic
   ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow) step 6). Nothing to author, no benchmarking, no training — the pack is
   fully functional and model-free from day one. (An author who prefers the intent recorded rather than
   inferred can name an explicit `static_order` UHD; it is not required.)
2. **Generate a real heuristic from on-hardware timings.** A standalone generation tool loads the pack
   **through a UED exposing every KMD field** ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)),
   times its kernels across a corpus of problem shapes, trains a model, and emits an updated UED/UHD —
   now `adapter: tree_data` pointing at an exported model, with the categorical encoding and
   `trained_against` revisions it was built from. Dropping that updated engine descriptor set back in
   upgrades the pack in place. The emitted UED's `knobs` are **derived from the trained feature set** —
   the axes that survived feature selection ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)),
   which is normally fewer than the generation UED exposed.
   **OPEN:** See [Open Question 10](#operational) (shape corpus location).

Because the shipped and generated heuristics are the same descriptor kind differing only in `adapter`
and fields, the tool only rewrites data; it never introduces a new interface. The tool runs over
hipDNN's public API — it adds no code to hipDNN and touches no provider internals — so it works for
any provider's pack.

### 13.1.1 What the Author Supplies, and When

The same pipeline serves first-time generation and regeneration; what differs is how much of it has to
re-run. The trigger determines whether the existing timings can be reused or a new sweep is required,
which is the expensive distinction:

```
What changed?
│
├─ Nothing yet — first heuristic for this pack
│     author supplies: problem corpus, a fully-exposed UED (Section 13.2),
│                      the dim↔tile correspondences (Section 13.6)
│     → full sweep → train → emit UHD + UED
│
├─ Model quality only (more data, better fit; catalog unchanged)
│     author supplies: additional corpus
│     → extend sweep → retrain → re-emit UHD          [timings reusable, extended]
│
├─ Knobs pruned (feature dropped; kernels unchanged)
│     author supplies: nothing
│     → refit from existing timings → re-emit UHD + UED   [no new benchmarking]
│
├─ Kernels removed from the pack
│     author supplies: nothing
│     → no model change required; scores are per-candidate, so removing
│       candidates cannot alter the ranking of those remaining (Section 14.4)
│
├─ Kernels added, or applicability widened
│     author supplies: corpus covering the new cohort
│     → sweep the new candidates → retrain → re-emit       [new timings needed]
│
├─ KMD changed (any change — see Section 8.1)
│     author supplies: corpus if the change admits new candidates
│     → regenerate; a breaking change requires it, an additive one is advised
│
├─ Problem inputs or op attributes changed (new bindable fields)
│     author supplies: updated signature intent; the tool re-derives Layer 1
│     → re-emit signature → retrain                        [Section 13.6]
│
└─ Target device family widened (new arch, or a SKU at a different CU count)
      author supplies: access to the new hardware
      → sweep there → either a new arch-keyed entry (Section 3.1)
        or added coverage under the existing one (Section 13.5)
```

Two properties of this table are worth stating directly, because they are what make regeneration cheap.
**Narrowing never needs new data:** pruning knobs refits from timings already collected, and dropping
kernels needs no refit of the per-candidate ranker at all. The engine estimate is the exception, and
scopes that claim: `predict_engine` predicts the engine's achievable throughput rather than any
one candidate's, so removing the kernel that *was* the winner for a cohort invalidates it even though
`sort_kernel_catalog` still ranks the survivors correctly
([Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker)). **Widening always does:** a
candidate, a cohort, or a device the sweep never saw has no evidence behind it, and no amount of
refitting manufactures any.

### 13.2 Benchmarking via the hipDNN Bench CLI

The timing substrate is **`hipdnn_bench`**, hipDNN's own benchmark tool, driving hipDNN's timing loop
over explicitly enrolled candidates. It is provider-agnostic: it times whatever engine/kernel actually
runs, so it exercises a rocKE pack exactly as it would any other engine. **The UHD itself never runs
kernels** — it is scored data. The generation tool is a separate program that shells out to the bench
CLI, logs the results, and trains the model; it reaches the engine only through that tool's public
surface, which is itself only the public Graph API:

- **Enumerate the applicable catalog** for a graph, paged and with a total count, so a large catalog is
  walked in bounded requests rather than held whole. Each entry arrives with its full knob tuple, which
  is the identity a timing is attributed to.
- **Enroll every enumerated candidate of one graph in a single invocation**, each by its complete knob
  tuple. Collection pins *restrict* which candidates are enrolled; a candidate's own settings are never
  combined with them. One enrolled tuple times exactly one candidate, so a measurement is never
  attributed to a set.
- **Time each enrolled candidate** to convergence, iterating until the trailing-window coefficient of
  variation settles rather than for a fixed iteration count.
- **Record per-candidate results** — the engine, the knob tuple, min / mean / robust-mean / stddev
  timings, iteration count, and workspace size — persisted as JSON. That JSON, joined with the feature
  row, is the training dataset.

Enrolling enumerated candidates, rather than sweeping a Cartesian product of knob axes, is what makes
the pipeline viable on a sparse catalog: cost scales with the number of kernels that exist, not with the
product of the ranges they span.

**One process per graph, not per candidate.** A corpus is 10^4–10^6 rows, and a process per row pays
plugin load, graph build and kernel compilation for every one of them — costs that are identical across
the candidates of one graph and dominate the sub-millisecond kernels being timed. Sweeping inside one
process amortises all three. Measured on a 185-graph collection, a process per row spent ≈0.87 s per
row against kernels running well under a millisecond; nearly all of it was startup.

The cost of amortising is **crash isolation granularity**, and it is a deliberate trade rather than an
oversight. A candidate that fails to build, fails to run, or is declined is reported as an unsuccessful
result and still reaches the corpus as the failure it is — that is unaffected. A candidate that *crashes
the process* takes its graph's remaining rows with it rather than only its own. Per-graph is the right
granularity for that: a graph is the unit a row is already grouped by, the loss is bounded and visible
as thin coverage ([Section 13.5](#135-sweep-space-grid-vs-constraint)) rather than as silent corruption,
and the collection's total exposure falls because it finishes in a fraction of the wall time.

**Autotune is not the substrate, and deliberately so.** hipDNN's autotune ([RFC 0013](0013_Autotune.md))
exists to *select* a winner and to persist that winner; this pipeline needs a *measurement for every
candidate*, which is the opposite shape. Driving selection to obtain a dataset means fighting its
purpose: its job is to stop early and keep one answer, and every row it discards is a row this pipeline
exists to record. The bench CLI already drives the same timing loop over explicitly enrolled variants
with no selection step, so the statistics are hipDNN's own either way — what differs is that nothing
decides on the generator's behalf.

**A timing is only a training label once the candidate is known correct.** The tool validates each
candidate's numerical output against a reference before accepting its measurement, and records the
verdict on the row. Speed alone is not evidence of a usable kernel, and the two failure directions are
not symmetric:

- **A wrong-but-fast candidate is the dangerous one.** A kernel that executes, returns quickly, and
  computes the wrong answer produces the *best* timing in its group, so it becomes the label the model
  is trained to prefer. Nothing downstream catches it: the contract checks
  ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)) fingerprint the feature contract, not the kernel's output.
  Without a correctness gate the oracle is silently inverted for that problem.
- **A missing candidate is a coverage gap, not a corruption.** A kernel wrongly excluded by a matcher
  never appears, so the model simply never learns it — the trained ranking is intact but incomplete.

Both are recorded rather than dropped. A candidate that builds and runs but fails validation is written
with its measurement suppressed and an explicit invalid marker, so the model learns the failure surface
instead of inferring one from absence; a candidate that never became applicable is absent by
construction and is visible only as thin coverage for that problem
([Section 13.5](#135-sweep-space-grid-vs-constraint)).

**Recording an invalid candidate is diagnosis, not remedy.** A suppressed timing protects the training
labels; it does not stop the kernel from running. The scorer cannot exclude a candidate
([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)), so a kernel that is applicable and incorrect stays selectable through
every path that does not consult the model: a knob pin that filters the correct candidates away, a
winning candidate that fails to build and is skipped (step 7), or any `static_order` fallback. A learned
demotion is a preference, and preference is not a correctness gate — the ranking that demotes it is
precisely the thing each of those paths bypasses.

A correctness defect is therefore resolved where correctness is decided, in the matcher or the kernel:
**package emission fails while any candidate carries an unresolved invalid marker**
([Section 13.4](#134-new-stage-package-stage-p)). The author narrows the pack's UMD so the kernel is no
longer applicable for those problems, or withdraws the UKD; generation re-runs and the marker clears.
The invalid rows stay in the dataset for diagnostics either way, so the model still learns the failure
surface — it is simply no longer the only thing standing between a wrong kernel and a result.

Because applicability decides which candidates are ever timed, an incorrect matcher biases the dataset
before any model sees it. **OPEN:** what reference the tool validates against per op, and whether
generation additionally checks matcher coverage — that a problem's candidate set is plausible rather
than merely non-empty — see [Open Question 19](#operational).

The tool times the **shipped** kernels — it does not re-build a variant grid. The pack is the authority
on which variants exist; autotune is the authority on how fast each one runs.

**Generate against a fully-addressable UED; ship the engine's authored knobs.** The generation path
addresses kernels through knob settings, so a kernel the tool cannot name is a kernel it cannot time.
The generation UED therefore exposes every addressable KMD field, making the knob tuple equal to the
metadata tuple and every catalog entry individually reachable. A field the exposure cannot carry leaves
its kernels sharing a tuple, and generation stops on that collision rather than timing an ambiguous
candidate ([Section 13.3](#133-one-source-of-truth-translated-once)).

Feature selection then prunes the axes that do not earn their place **in the model**. It does not prune
the engine's knobs. The emitted UED keeps its authored `knobs` — that list is the engine's public tuning
surface, read by its UMDs and by callers who pin
([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)) — and the trained feature set is
checked to be contained in it ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)). A knob the model stopped
reading is reported so the engine's author can decide whether it still earns its place; withdrawing it
is their call and a deliberate engine change, not a side effect of a training run. Benchmark wide, and
let the model keep what it can use.

The generation manifest records both sets — the knobs the collection UED exposed and the knobs the
shipping UED declares — so the difference between what was addressable and what is tunable stays
visible rather than being inferred from a diff.

### 13.3 One Source of Truth, Translated Once

The tool guarantees that the runtime contract matches what was benchmarked. It emits the pack's
descriptors (updated UED/UHD, and the KMD/`features_signature` if not already present) from the same run
that produced the timings — generate-then-freeze — so descriptor, dataset, and runtime are consistent by
construction.

The tool freezes and emits two contracts:

1. **Feature contract.** Emit the UHD's `features_signature` ([Section 6.2](#62-the-features_signature))
   from the same feature definition training used (expressions over `$q.* / $kernel.* / $device.*`).
   Then **one generic extractor runs it on both sides** — offline for training, the in-tree evaluator
   for inference — both reading the *same* signature. No reimplementation, so no drift. (Caveat: the
   expression op set must cover the derived features — [Section 6.2](#62-the-features_signature)'s
   `log2`/`/`/`min`/`max` extension. A computation outside that set uses the `custom_library` featurizer
   escape hatch.)
2. **Kernel-identity contract.** The candidate the bench timed must map 1:1 to the **UKD** it stands for
   in the emitted pack, so the model's argmax over timed candidates maps exactly to argmax over UKDs at
   runtime. The join key is the knob tuple reported on each result; because generation runs against a
   fully-exposed UED, that tuple is the kernel's metadata tuple, which is unique engine-wide and validated
   as such at load. This drift risk carries two obligations:
   - **Verify that `knobSettings` round-trips.** The tool must confirm the settings reported back on a
     result select the same kernel they enrolled, rather than assuming it.
   - **A collision during generation is a dataset error, and means exposure is incomplete.** If two
     enrolled candidates share a tuple, timings cannot be attributed to a kernel. Under full exposure
     this cannot happen, so it indicates the generation UED did not expose every KMD field — fail loudly
     rather than train on an ambiguous join. (At *runtime*, once the emitted UED exposes only the model's
     feature axes, two kernels differing solely in dispatch-only fields will share a knob tuple; they
     score identically and the tie-break separates them, with a load-time warning —
     [Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes).)

### 13.4 New Stage: Package (Stage P)

From one timing run ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)) the tool trains the catalog ranker
(`sort_kernel_catalog`) and, when needed, the engine estimate (`predict_engine`)
([Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker)). A package stage then emits (or
updates) the engine's descriptor set:

- **`sort_kernel_catalog`** — rewritten from the shipped `static_order` (or absent) to
  `adapter: tree_data`, carrying the `features_signature` (referencing `$kernel.*` KMD fields and
  `$device.*` for arch-awareness), `features_hash`, `objective`/`score`, and the adapter-scoped
  `tree_data` body ([Section 4](#4-uhd-schema)); per engine and arch-keyed, so no artifact table;
- **`predict_engine`** — the coarse `f(graph) → expected metric value` model the quick policy ranks
  engines by ([Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007)), emitted as data on the UED
  when the engine needs it;
- **one UHD per requested metric, at each level** — a run names the metrics it trains
  ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)); each metric fixes its label (`tflops` from the binding layer's
  FLOPs over `avgTimeMs`, `time` from `avgTimeMs` directly), its `objective`, and its `score` block, so
  a trainer cannot pair a label with the wrong direction. One timing run feeds both `tflops` and `time`.
  Emission **adds** each UHD to the role list under its architecture key, replacing only a UHD of the same
  metric ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships));
- **the model files** — the trained boosters exported to the `tree_data` format read by the in-tree
  walker ([Section 7](#7-model-adapters)), each embedding the `features_hash` it was trained against,
  shipped with the engine descriptors rather than compiled in;
- **the KMD** — the compilation-knob schema (`fields`: `tile_m`, `warp_n`, `split_k`, `dtype`, …), if the
  pack does not already carry one; its fields are the `$kernel.*` metadata the UKDs fill
  ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)) — one KMD per engine, owned by
  the UED;
- **the UED** — updated to reference the new UHDs in the role map for this architecture. Its `knobs`
  are authored by the engine and are not rewritten by generation
  ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)).

Only the heuristic side changes in the ordinary case: the UMDs, UDD, and child UKDs are not regenerated.
This is the intent of the two-stage design — the expensive artifacts (compiled kernels) ship once, and
the heuristics are layered on afterward as data.

The one case that reaches back into the pack is a correctness defect the timing run exposed
([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)). Emission is gated on none being outstanding,
and clearing one is a matcher or kernel change rather than a heuristic change. That is a deliberate
exception to the layering, not a hole in it: the stage that discovers an incorrect kernel is the only
stage positioned to refuse to ship it.

### 13.5 Sweep Space: Grid vs. Constraint

The generation tool sweeps two things: the **problem-shape corpus** (batch, seqlen, heads, and the like —
supplied by the author as representative shapes, or a per-op default) and optionally the **exposed knobs**
(the KMD fields the engine lets a user set, enrolled as explicit knob settings). A knob setting only
*filters* the catalog ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)), so
sweeping knobs explores user-visible restrictions, not new kernels. The variant space is fixed: it is the
pack's existing child UKDs, so the tool does not enumerate or build variants but enrolls the shipped ones
and times them ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)). That holds within this pipeline;
deciding which variants exist, and pruning them once a heuristic exists, is the upstream
package-creation-time stage of
[Section 14](#14-package-creation-time-selection-knobs-and-aot-kernels).

One subtlety for anything that *drives* a sweep from a descriptor: a validity *constraint*
(`min:1, max:8`) expresses which values are **legal**, not which to **sample**. A `[min, max, step]`
triple ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)) makes a regular axis enumerable
without guessing the increment, which covers most numeric knobs; an irregular axis still needs an
explicit `sweep_values` list. Neither addresses *cross-knob* validity — that is the enumeration gap of
[Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli). **OPEN**: standardize where the shape corpus and
any knob grid live (a tool-side config vs. a descriptor field), so a heuristic can be regenerated
reproducibly without out-of-band inputs.

**Device coverage is a third sweep axis, and the tool checks it.** A gfx target is not one machine: CU
count varies across SKUs of the same architecture (gfx942 spans parts with materially different CU
counts), and `gcnArchName` does not distinguish them — every such SKU resolves to the same arch key in the
UED's heuristic maps ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)) and therefore to the same UHD. A sweep
run on one machine sees one value for every `$device.*` field.

Cross-SKU use is the intended behavior, not a defect ([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)), but
it constrains what the signature may contain. The generation tool therefore checks device coverage before
it emits, and warns when the target architecture is known to ship at multiple CU counts while the sweep
covered only one:

> `warning: gfx942 ships SKUs at several CU counts; this sweep observed $device.cu_count = 304 only.
>  Features computed from it are calibrated to that value.`

The rule the warning enforces: a device value MAY appear raw in a `features_signature` regardless of
sweep coverage, but MUST NOT appear inside a computed feature unless the sweep varied it. The two cases
degrade differently, which is why they are treated differently:

- **Raw and constant is inert.** A zero-variance feature yields no split in a tree model, so the trained
  ranking never depends on it and a different device changes nothing. The model is simply CU-agnostic.
- **Computed from a constant is not.** `total_tiles / $device.cu_count` with a fixed denominator is a
  rescaled `total_tiles`; the model does split on it, and those thresholds are calibrated to the one CU
  count the sweep saw. On another SKU every value shifts systematically, and the splits no longer fall
  where they were placed. A ratio pre-commits to a relationship; separate raw features let the model form
  it only when the data supports it.

So the tool declines to emit device-derived features when the underlying field was constant, keeps the raw
entry, and records the observed value in the model metadata so the condition is visible after the fact.
Sweeping several SKUs under one arch removes the restriction and is the better answer where the hardware
is available: the field then varies, the model learns its effect, and intra-arch differences become
learnable rather than something the signature must avoid.

### 13.6 Auto-Deriving a First-Pass `features_signature`

Most of a `features_signature` can be **derived from what a package already carries**, so the tool can
propose a first pass rather than requiring an author to hand-write the feature list. The key is that
"map the graph to features" spans **two layers**, and only the first is shared/derivable:

- **Layer 1 — op-intrinsic vocabulary (per op, shared).** The fields that *exist and are bindable*:
  tensor/dim bindings (`$q.dims[2]`), node attributes (`$q.dims[3]`), device properties
  (`$device.*`), and **precomputed fields the binding system supplies automatically**. These are facts
  about the op, identical for every engine that implements it
  ([Section 6](#6-feature-extraction)).
- **Layer 2 — the `features_signature` (per package/UHD, not shared).** *Which* of those fields a given
  model consumes, plus derived transforms. This is per-UHD: two packages of the same op may rank on
  different subsets.

The tool auto-derives Layer 1 and proposes a Layer-2 first pass from it, in three tiers:

| Tier | Feature kind | Derivable from | Author input needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Raw fields (`$kernel.*` = KMD fields; tensor dims/attrs = the engine's published symbols; `$device.*`) | KMD schema + the UED's published symbol set + device vocab | **none** |
| 2 | Generic transforms (logs, ratios) and **tile/wave quantization** | Tier 1 + an expression pairing a problem dim with a `$kernel.*` tile axis | the **dim↔tile correspondence** — which dim goes with which tile field |
| 3 | **Physics** — arithmetic intensity, roofline bound | the op's FLOP and byte counts, divided inline | **none** — supplied as precomputed op fields (below) |

The tile/wave quantization (Tier 2) is not auto-inferable — the tool cannot guess that `seqlen_q` pairs
with `tile_m0`. It is the one genuine author input, and it is small: a list of (problem dim, tile field)
pairs. From that list the tool writes the quantization entries into the `features_signature` itself
([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)); the author supplies correspondences, not expressions.

**Arithmetic intensity, and where the FLOP/byte counts come from.** Intensity is
`total_FLOPs / total_bytes_moved` (FLOP/byte) — the roofline x-axis that separates compute-bound from
memory-bound problems, which is exactly the split that decides which kernel wins. Both terms are
closed-form over the bound dims and dtype sizes, but they are **op-specific** and cannot be inferred
from the KMD field list, so something has to supply them per op.

**They are precomputed fields, declared in the hipDNN schema.** The binding layer already publishes
derived values that no descriptor declares: `$q.stride_order` and `$q.packed` stand in for
contiguous-stride arithmetic, and `$q.value_f32` coerces a tensor's compile-time value to a single typed
token. Each is declared in the schema like any other field and versioned with it, so adding one is an
additive schema change rather than a per-pack extension point
([RFC 0020 §6](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#6-symbol-binding-what-the-pattern-publishes)). FLOP and
byte counts fit that mechanism, as per-op precomputed fields:

```jsonc
// available wherever an sdpa_fwd node is bound — no descriptor declares these
"$sdpa_fwd.flops"        // 4·B·H·Sq·Sk·D for SDPA forward
"$sdpa_fwd.bytes"        // sum over Q/K/V/O of element_count × that tensor's dtype size

// so a features_signature entry just divides them
"arithmetic_intensity": {"/": ["$sdpa_fwd.flops", "$sdpa_fwd.bytes"]}
```

These are **not** authored as expression strings in table-level `.fbs` annotations. Embedding an
expression language inside the schema file is awkward, and changing an `.fbs` requires codegen plus a
recompile regardless — so a schema annotation buys none of the data-driven flexibility that would
justify it. What needs a rebuild to change belongs in code, as a precomputed binding field.

Because they are **op-intrinsic** (SDPA's two GEMMs do `2·B·H·Sq·Sk·(hdim_q + hdim_v)` FLOPs regardless
of engine or package — the familiar `4·B·H·Sq·Sk·D` is the specialization where the Q and V head
dimensions are equal, which the frontend does not require), these fields live at Layer 1 and are shared
by every package of that op — defined once per op-family.
A `features_signature` then references intensity *identically* to a raw dim like `$q.dims[2]`, and the
Tier-3 "physics" distinction disappears at the point of use.

> **Coordinate with the UMD.** This says the op vocabulary should carry a *set* of useful precomputed
> fields — some universal across ops, some per-op — of which FLOPs and bytes are two. Where that set is
> defined and how per-op entries are registered is the UMD's to specify, not this RFC's; the requirement
> here is only that FLOP and byte counts be among them. See [Open Question 4](#schema-and-training).

Caveats:

- **Mixed-dtype ops** (e.g. fp8 in / fp16 accumulate, or differing I/O dtypes) make the byte count a sum
  over *per-tensor* dtype sizes, not one global `dtype_bytes`. Each tensor must contribute its own dtype
  — a single-dtype shortcut is wrong for quantized kernels.
- **Not every op has a clean closed form.** Ragged or data-dependent shapes (variable-length sequences,
  data-dependent masking) may make an exact count impossible; the field should then expose a documented
  upper bound or be absent rather than silently wrong, and a UHD that needs better can compute its own
  inline in the signature.
- **Auto-derivation yields a *superset*.** Deriving every raw field and generic transform produces a
  bloated, noisy vector that can hurt a small-data model; the sweep's feature-importance (or a curated
  per-op template) prunes it. Auto-derivation proposes; data or a template trims.

**A data-free structural first pass.** Tiers 1–2 alone (no benchmarking) already support a real
model-free heuristic better than `static_order`: prefer the kernel whose tile best divides the problem
(minimize quantization waste), tie-break on an occupancy proxy. That is a legitimate `table`/rule UHD
computable from the KMD, the engine's bound symbols, and device facts, and it is the zero-benchmark
starting point before
the autotune-trained `tree_data` model replaces it.

## 14. Package-Creation-Time Selection: Knobs and AOT Kernels

Everything above concerns *runtime* selection (which kernel wins for a graph) and *model* generation
(training a UHD for a fixed pack). This section covers the stage upstream of both: deciding **which knobs
a package exposes** and **which kernels it compiles AOT** — that is, generating the UED and the UKD set
itself, at **package creation time**.

It is a distinct heuristics area, and it closes a loop with
[Section 13](#13-model-generation-pipeline): a generated heuristic is one of the inputs used to prune
knobs, and the pruned knob set then changes which kernels are worth compiling.

> **Requirements, not a design — and likely a separate RFC.** This section exists to record what the
> UHD must *support* for package creation to work: that the same timing substrate is reusable when the
> variant space itself is what varies, that a trained heuristic's feature importances are a usable
> pruning signal, and that a regenerated knob set feeds back into both the KMD and the feature space.
> The algorithms — prioritization objective, search-space refinement, pruning thresholds — are
> deliberately left open, and the package-creation pipeline should be specified in its own document
> rather than expanded here.

### 14.1 AOT Selection Depends on Whether the Engine Can JIT

The goal of AOT differs sharply between two regimes.

**Engine can JIT in hipDNN — AOT is a cost optimization.** AOT exists to cut compile cost for the
kernels that actually get used. Coverage is *not* the objective, because the JIT path already covers the
space; AOT only needs the most-used, most-performant subset. All knobs are available, and compiling a
subset trades package size and build time against runtime compile latency.
**Goal: select the best kernels for a representative set of data.**

**Engine cannot JIT in hipDNN — AOT is the entire functional surface.** Here the compiled kernels are
everything the engine can do, so the set needs *both* good coverage and good performance. This is the
case when JIT has not been built (rocKE today), is never planned, or the kernel generator is not
JIT-able (CK). In this regime hipDNN **cannot inform** AOT selection — it can only **filter** an
already-generated set to reduce package size and runtime load. That filtering can feed back into knob
generation, but it **cannot reduce the up-front cost of variant explosion**, which happens in the
engine's own generator before hipDNN sees anything.
**Goal: filter the worst kernels to reduce size, without losing coverage.**

| | Engine can JIT | Engine cannot JIT |
|---|---|---|
| Role of AOT | compile-cost optimization | the entire functional surface |
| Coverage requirement | low — JIT is the fallback | high — nothing else fills the gap |
| Objective | **select the best** for the data | **filter the worst** to reduce size |
| hipDNN's leverage | can inform *what to build* | can only filter *what was already built* |

### 14.2 Pipeline: AOT Selection

1. **Generate an unoptimized KDP** that exposes all possible knobs (for JIT or AOT), through tooling
   plus user generation.
2. **Benchmark that KDP through hipDNN** using the exposed knobs, over an *algorithmically refined*
   search space rather than the full cross-product — and, where relevant, over **targeted datasets for
   specific clients**.
3. **Post-hoc algorithmic evaluation** to prioritize the candidate list: frequency of kernel use, the
   time cost of a poor selection, and similar signals.
4. **Modify the KDP** to include the AOT kernels selected (or newly created) by that evaluation, on
   coverage / frequency / performance.

Step 2 uses the same timing substrate as [Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli); what
differs is *what varies* (the variant space itself, not just the shape corpus) and *what the output
drives* (the pack's kernel set, not a model).

**Coverage is the kernel author's call, and it follows the data they chose.** Pruning an AOT set for a
non-JIT engine narrows the engine's whole supported surface ([Section 14.1](#141-aot-selection-depends-on-whether-the-engine-can-jit)),
so the risk is a cohort losing its only applicable kernel. This RFC sets no automatic guard for that,
because the evidence the decision rests on is the author's: they select the problem corpus the sweep runs,
they choose which knobs it varies, and they validate the result. What the tooling can state plainly is
that **coverage of the emitted set scales with the size and variability of the data behind it** — a
corpus that never exercised a cohort offers no evidence about it, and pruning against that corpus prunes
blind. Whether a knob is removed, and what coverage is sufficient before removing it, remains the
author's decision.

### 14.3 Knob Selection: Static vs. Empirical

**Static analysis.** Largely package/project dependent, driven by the kernel author — increasingly with
LLM assistance — and limited tooling. This is likely **not** an area the heuristics team owns directly.
It answers two questions from the code: which knobs indicate that a **separate engine** is warranted
rather than one super-engine, and which knobs are **dead or low-impact** for performance.

**Empirical.** Requires a generation-and-execution loop. That loop can live **inside hipDNN** when the
engine supports both JIT and AOT; otherwise it must live **in the engine's own codebase**, wherever the
generation/execution loop can actually run.

### 14.4 Pipeline: Knob Reduction (hipDNN JIT Case)

1. **Generate an unoptimized KDP** exposing all possible knobs for JIT.
2. **Benchmark through hipDNN** over an algorithmically refined search space.
3. **Generate heuristics** from the results ([Section 13](#13-model-generation-pipeline)).
4. **Backwards-evaluate the heuristics** to find the weakest knobs — the axes the trained model barely
   uses.
5. **Regenerate the UED** with the reduced knob set.
6. **Regenerate the AOT kernels** from the reduced knobs, or run the AOT-selection pipeline
   ([Section 14.2](#142-pipeline-aot-selection)).

Step 4 is the same signal as the feature-importance pruning noted in
[Section 13.6](#136-auto-deriving-a-first-pass-features_signature) — there it trims a bloated
`features_signature`; here it trims the **knob space itself**. A knob the model never splits on is a knob
whose variants are not earning their package size.

**Steps 4–5 collapse into one action.** Because `UED.knobs` *is* the model's feature set
([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)), pruning a weak feature and dropping a
knob are the same edit rather than two that have to be kept consistent by hand. Emitting the pruned UHD
emits the reduced UED with it, and the [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement) equality check guarantees
they cannot drift apart.

Step 6 then closes the loop: a smaller knob set means fewer variant axes worth compiling, which shrinks
the AOT explosion, which changes what the next model sees.

**What a reduction does and does not cost.** Worth separating, because only one of these is expensive:

- **Pruning knobs** — the UHD is *regenerated* (the model is refit without the dropped features), but
  from the **timings already collected**. No new benchmarking. This is the cheap direction, and the
  purpose of the loop.
- **Dropping kernels** (step 6 emits a smaller AOT set) — costs nothing at all for the model. A UHD
  scores each candidate independently, so removing candidates cannot change the scores of those that
  remain; the model simply never sees the dropped ones. This is **filtering and ranking commute** doing
  the work.
- **Growing** either the knob set or the kernel set beyond what was benchmarked — this is the expensive
  direction, and it needs a new sweep, because there are no timings for the new axes or variants
  ([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)).

So the loop converges cheaply as long as it only ever narrows. **Benchmarking is the expensive step, and
reduction never re-triggers it.**

### 14.5 Relationship to the Model-Generation Pipeline

[Section 13.5](#135-sweep-space-grid-vs-constraint) states that the variant space is *fixed* for model
generation — the tool enrolls the pack's existing UKDs and times them. That holds **within** that
pipeline. This section is the stage where the variant space is actually **decided**, and where a
generated heuristic feeds back to change it. The two run in sequence and iterate:

```
pack (all knobs) → benchmark → heuristic → prune knobs → regenerate pack → benchmark → heuristic → …
```

**OPEN items for this area:**

- The **prioritization objective** for AOT selection (step 3): how to weigh frequency of use against the
  time cost of a poor selection, and how client-specific targeted datasets factor in.
- How the **search-space refinement** algorithm works, and whether it is shared with the shape-corpus
  sweep of [Section 13.5](#135-sweep-space-grid-vs-constraint).
- The **pruning threshold** for a "weak" knob, and whether pruning is automatic or a proposal for author
  review.
- For the **non-JIT** case, whether anything can feed back into the *engine's own generator* to reduce
  variant explosion at the source, rather than only filtering after the fact.

## 15. Phased Delivery

Each phase is independently shippable and validated against the SDPA path and the reference tooling,
using the parity and overhead checks of [RFC 0017 §14.1](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#141-testing-and-performance).

The ordering establishes the ranking seam before the data-driven machinery. Phases 1–3 stand up the UHD
path — schema, wiring, ranking, load and cache, engine integration — using ranking mechanisms that need no
new file format, no parser, and no generic extractor. The data-driven adapters land only once the seam is
in place and measured, so a defect in the seam surfaces against a function rather than against a model
pipeline built on top of it.

| Phase | Deliverable | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | No-UHD default + `static_order` | UHD header schema + UED membership. An engine naming **no** UHD returns the catalog in deterministic `priority`/`id` order and warns — the zero-authoring starting state. `static_order` makes the same intent explicit. Proves UED→UHD→catalog wiring end to end. |
| 2 | `native` adapter | Scorer compiled into the engine, named by symbol ([Section 7.1](#71-first-native)). Exercises real ranking, `objective`/`score`, and the ranked-catalog output with no new format. Establishes the performance baseline everything later is measured against. |
| 3 | `tree_data` (escape-hatched) | The tree-table format and the **new in-tree GBDT walker written for this work** — a bounded parser and evaluator with no external dependency — behind a hand-written featurizer rather than the generic extractor. Lands the real FMHA-fwd model. Adds lazy load + per-engine model cache. |
| 4 | `features_signature` + generic extractor | Replaces the hand-written featurizer: inline signature with computed entries, one extractor over the shared namespaces, subexpression hash-consing, `features_hash` over signature + encoding, training↔runtime parity test. |
| 5 | Generation tool | Standalone tool wrapping hipDNN: enumerates each graph's applicable catalog, times every enrolled candidate, logs results, trains, and emits an updated UHD + model alongside the engine's UED role map. |
| 6 | `table` | Cheap bucketed heuristics for ops that don't warrant a model. |
| 7 | Engine-selection integration | Score-only mode, the A/B plugin-query surface, engine-selection policies. Introduces the engine estimate (A) — not needed before competing or opaque engines exist ([Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker)). Co-owned with [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md). |
| 7a | Ranking metrics ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics), [Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric)) | Lands in four independently shippable steps, each keeping `tflops` the default so no step changes a request that names no metric: (1) the metric registry, `score.metric`, list-valued role maps and the loader's `(role, arch, metric)` index; (2) the metric on the plugin query, the metric-carrying answer and the capability query; (3) the request's ranking metric, direction-aware policies, and the quick policy's L1-only rule; (4) the metric carried to plan build and into every ranking cache key. Generation emits several metrics from one timing run alongside step 1. |
| 8 | `custom_library` | Author-shipped scorer `.so` for models the in-tree walker doesn't cover. Dependency + trust audit gated ([Open Question 11](#operational)). |
| 9 | AOT selection ([Section 14.2](#142-pipeline-aot-selection)) | Benchmark an all-knobs KDP, prioritize by frequency / cost-of-poor-selection, emit the AOT kernel set. Needed first for **non-JIT** engines (rocKE today, CK), where it is filtering rather than selection. Depends on phase 5. |
| 10 | Knob reduction loop ([Section 14.4](#144-pipeline-knob-reduction-hipdnn-jit-case)) | Backwards-evaluate a generated heuristic for weak knobs, regenerate the UED with a reduced knob set, then regenerate AOT kernels. Requires an engine that can **JIT in hipDNN**; depends on phases 5 and 9. |

Phases 3 and 4 split the model format from the generic feature path: shipping `tree_data` behind a
hand-written featurizer puts a trained model in place before the declarative extractor is ready, and makes
the extractor's parity test a comparison against a known-good implementation.

`onnx`, `lgbm_to_c` (build-time, in-tree perf optimization only), and `lightgbm_native` are
dependency-gated and land only when a concrete need appears.

---

## 16. Risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Feature-contract drift** | Training and inference feature vectors diverge | Single `features_signature` drives both sides via one generic extractor; four-part load-time check ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)); computed features are **inline**, so the signature *is* the computation and `features_hash` cannot miss a redefinition ([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)) |
| **Catalog not enumerable** | Reconstructing candidates from independently reported knob ranges yields a cross-product a sparse catalog barely intersects, so a large knob space cannot be swept | Generation enumerates the applicable catalog directly, paged, and enrolls one complete candidate per timed run, so cost is linear in the catalog rather than in the cross-product ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)) |
| **Knob-set churn** | A retrain drops a feature and takes a caller's knob with it | Cannot happen: `UED.knobs` is the engine's authored public surface and the model's feature set is a subset of it, so feature selection never withdraws a knob ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes), [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)). Removing a knob is a deliberate engine-authoring change, stamped as a breaking content revision ([Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling)); an unread knob is reported so the author can decide |
| **Kernel-identity drift** | Timed candidate doesn't match emitted UKD | Generation runs fully exposed, so the join key is the full metadata tuple; verify `knobSettings` round-trips; a collision during generation fails loudly ([Section 13.3](#133-one-source-of-truth-translated-once)) |
| **KMD↔UHD coupling** | a *breaking* KMD change (removed/reinterpreted field) invalidates the trained model | Explicit revision rule at load (breaking `==`, additive `<=`) over the KMD's content revision, which is a separate axis from its file-format `version`; additive changes need no retrain until exposed ([Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling)); model disabled (not request failed) on mismatch |
| **Out-of-distribution input** | New arch, or a dropped-in pack whose values the model never saw; the contract still passes, only the values are new | The model artifact declares the architectures it was trained on and the runtime refuses an estimate for an unseen one; a candidate whose recovered score is non-finite or non-positive is distrusted individually and reported as 0; per-feature range coverage kept additive as a later option ([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)) |
| **Dependency creep** | Pressure to link `liblightgbm` at runtime | In-tree `tree_data` default; runtime deps stay opt-in only |
| **Bad/stale model** | Model picks worse than first-match | Degrade to `static_order`; parity gate against the `native` baseline; model provenance in trace |
| **Malformed drop-in heuristic** | Third-party UHD with a broken feature contract reaches a customer | Never fails the request — model disabled, error logged, estimate reported as 0 ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow) step 8); CI validation over shipped packs is the primary gate ([Open Question 14](#operational)) |
| **Miscalibrated cross-engine scores** | Absolute score misleads engine selection | Train calibratable TFLOPS from start; fall back to rank-ordering at policy level if calibration unreliable |
| **Selection CPU overhead** | Per-candidate scoring on the plan-build path costs more than it saves | Wall-clock load / extract / score separately against the `native` baseline; shared-prefix split; single-candidate short-circuit ([Section 9.4](#94-latency-target)) |
| **Cache key incompleteness** | Result cache returns wrong kernel | Fingerprint must include problem + candidate set + device |
| **Drop-in trust** | Model artifact is author-controlled input | Bounded loader/evaluator; inherit [RFC 0017 §12](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#12-packaging-and-delivery) trust rules |

## 17. Open Questions

### Schema and Training

1. **Regressor vs. ranker.** The tooling trains a *regressor* on TFLOPS and argmaxes. A
   learning-to-rank objective (LambdaRank/NDCG) optimizes ordering directly and may pick better
   *within* an engine without needing calibrated absolute values. But a calibrated TFLOPS *regressor*
   is what makes the absolute, cross-comparable metric of [Section 11.3](#113-cross-engine-comparison)
   possible; a pure ranker forecloses that and leaves only the rank-ordering path. Recommendation:
   regressor, preserving the absolute option, with ranking as the fallback rather than the only mode.
   *(Impacts [Section 4](#4-uhd-schema), [Section 11.3](#113-cross-engine-comparison).)*

2. **Arch-aware model scope.** The UHD is one per engine, and the engine spans arches (`arch` is a KDP
   property), so the model is arch-aware via `$device.*` features — one model generalizing across the
   engine's arches. A per-engine model assumes `$device.*` features capture the cross-arch differences
   well enough; where they do not, the arch-keyed heuristic maps ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships))
   split the model per arch, and an engine may additionally be scoped more narrowly (a UED per
   arch/dtype). Decide the default split against real cross-arch accuracy data.
   *(Impacts [Section 3](#3-ownership-model).)*

3. **`tree_data` artifact format — RESOLVED.** The artifact is a FlatBuffer carrying the GBDT ensemble,
   `Verifier`-gated and additively evolvable, with a convert step at build rather than a `model.txt`
   parser hardened against hostile input ([Section 7.2](#72-default-tree_data)). The schema stores each
   tree as parallel per-node arrays and carries the model's feature contract, its base score, and its
   training provenance, so coverage metadata rides in the artifact as
   [Open Question 16](#operational) required rather than forcing a later format change.
   *(Impacts [Section 7.2](#72-default-tree_data).)*

4. **Derived feature set.** Arithmetic intensity, tile quantization, aspect ratios, occupancy,
   padding-fit — are there others? Candidates: memory-footprint / working-set vs. cache and HBM
   capacity; a compute-vs-memory-bound flag from intensity vs. the device's roofline ridge point;
   wave-quantization *tail* (last-wave occupancy); K-splitting overhead for split-K variants.
   Enumerate the final set against real per-op sweeps before freezing.
   *(The expression-op question is resolved — the UMD's operator set already covers the derived
   features.)* *(Impacts [Section 6.2](#62-the-features_signature).)*
   **Auto-derivation dependency:** the physics features (arithmetic intensity, roofline bound) need
   per-op **FLOP and byte counts as precomputed fields**, declared in the hipDNN schema alongside the
   existing precomputed values such as `$q.stride_order` and `$q.packed`
   ([Section 13.6](#136-auto-deriving-a-first-pass-features_signature)). The mechanism and its home are
   settled; what remains open is which per-op counts to declare, and the mixed-dtype byte convention. Tier-2 quantization (the
   dim↔tile correspondence) is written inline in the signature
   ([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)), from an author-supplied list of (problem dim, tile field)
   pairs.

### Structural

5. **Independently-authored packs joining one engine.** The catalog is engine-scoped and one
   `sort_kernel_catalog` UHD ranks the union across packs ([Section 5](#5-selection-flow)), so overlapping packs do *not* produce
   incomparable scores — but they do produce a catalog the model may never have seen. A UHD trained on
   pack A's kernels is asked to rank A ∪ B when B is dropped in later, and nothing in the load-time
   contract check catches it: the `features_signature` still resolves, because B's kernels fill the same
   KMD fields. The model silently extrapolates. Options: (a) adding a pack to an engine requires
   republishing that engine's UHD, retrained over the union — safe, but couples pack authors to the
   engine owner; (b) accept extrapolation, on the theory that a model over `$kernel.*` metadata
   generalizes to unseen kernels with in-distribution metadata, and add a training-coverage warning to
   the trace when a scored candidate falls outside the trained range; (c) restrict v1 to a single
   authoring owner per engine. Recommendation: (a) for v1, with (b)'s coverage warning as the detection
   mechanism — it is the only option that surfaces, at a drop-in pack's boundary, what the model was
   trained to rank.
   *(Impacts [Section 5](#5-selection-flow), [Section 8.2](#82-model-updates), [Section 16](#16-risks).)*

6. **Engine estimate (A) vs. config UHD (B) — RESOLVED.** Both forms exist and are not alternatives:
   an engine that ships a distinct `predict_engine` model answers the quick policy without
   enumerating its catalog; B's top calibrated score is a second estimate of the same metric, which the
   thorough policy prefers and the quick policy never consults
   ([Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007)). What the format fixes is the contract a
   distinct model must meet — graph-only features, a calibrated registered metric, an invertible
   transform, and a binding the engine grants rather than the descriptor claims — so that the two forms
   produce numbers that mean the same thing to a consumer.
   *(Impacts [Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker).)*

7. **Non-descriptor engine estimates.** How does a non-descriptor engine (e.g. MIOpen) report an
   A-level estimate through the plugin-query surface? If it cannot, the quick policy falls back to
   static ordering for it — acceptable for v1, but limits performance-based engine ranking.
   *(Impacts [Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007).)*

8. **The `predict_applicable_kernels` output contract.** The UED already reserves the field
   ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)), so *whether* an engine can carry a candidate generator
   is settled — a schema slot, not an open question. What is open is what that stage **emits** and where
   it lives. Producing candidate configurations that do not yet exist is not ranking; it yields new KMD
   tuples that feed the build path, closer to catalog synthesis
   ([Section 14](#14-package-creation-time-selection-knobs-and-aot-kernels)) than to selection. So: does
   the generator's output belong in a UHD adapter at all, or does `predict_applicable_kernels` name a
   descriptor that hands off to the package-creation tooling? And it runs *during* applicability
   ([Section 4.3](#43-future-predict_applicable_kernels-when-there-is-no-catalog-to-rank),
   [Section 10](#10-applicability-flow)), unlike every other role. Deferred until the JIT path is real.

### Operational

9. **Caching scope.** The in-process cache keyed on `(engine id, graph id, device id)` + inventory
   generation counter is sufficient for repeated graphs within a session, and needs nothing
   UHD-specific ([Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching)). Persistent cross-run caching is a different
   design — it needs the heuristic's content hash in the storage path, a device identity that is not the
   HIP ordinal, and a garbage-collection story — and it interacts with a future
   [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md) "cache selector" policy. Two things to settle
   before building it: whether persisting *rankings* repays its complexity at all when compilation and
   matching dominate the cost, and whether it should instead ride along with a persistent applicability
   or compiled-kernel cache. Defer until that policy is designed.
   *(Impacts [Section 9.2](#92-loading-and-caching).)*

10. **Shape corpus location.** The variant space is fixed (the pack's UKDs, timed via autotune), but
   the **shape corpus** and any **runtime-knob grid** need a home. A validity *constraint*
   (`min:1, max:8`) expresses which values are *legal*, not which to *sample*, so a swept axis needs
   an explicit `sweep_values` / grid hint, not an inferred range. Standardize: tool-side config (less
   coupled, easier to iterate) or descriptor field (reproducible from pack alone)?
   *(Impacts [Section 13.5](#135-sweep-space-grid-vs-constraint).)*

11. **Dependency + trust audit.** Needs deeper investigation: the exact allowed dependency surface
    for a shipped provider (license, distro packaging, ROCm image contents), and for `custom_library`
    the trust/signing rules for dropping in author-compiled native code. The former decides whether
    the in-tree tree-walker must be fully first-party or may vendor a third-party evaluator; the
    latter gates the `custom_library` drop-in path.
    *(Impacts [Section 7](#7-model-adapters), [Section 9.1](#91-dependencies).)*

12. **Enumerating the valid catalog — RESOLVED.** The generation path enumerates the applicable catalog
    directly, paged, with a total count, and enrolls one complete candidate per timed run rather than
    reconstructing candidates from a Cartesian product of knob ranges
    ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)). Enumeration returns candidates with their
    full knob tuple, so the identity a timing is attributed to is the one the catalog published, and a
    tuple collision during enumeration is a hard error rather than a silent join
    ([Section 13.3](#133-one-source-of-truth-translated-once)). This removes the sparse-catalog
    infeasibility outright: cost is now linear in the catalog rather than in the cross-product. What
    stays open is narrower and belongs to the hipDNN API rather than to this document — whether the
    enumeration is public or generation-only, and whether `[min, max, step]` lives on the KMD field or
    the UED knob ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)).
    *(Impacts [Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli), [Section 15](#15-phased-delivery) phase 5.)*

13. **Publishing the schema file.** [Section 4.1](#41-field-reference-normative) now carries a normative Draft-7
    block, validated against every shipping `version: "1.0"` descriptor. What remains is packaging it as
    the standalone per-version `uhd/1.0.json` with the CI parity check
    [RFC 0020 §4.2](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#42-normative-schema) defines, deciding where that
    file lives relative to the UED's, and extending it as `table`, `onnx`, and `custom_library` land.
    *(Impacts [Section 4](#4-uhd-schema).)*

14. **CI validation of shipped descriptor sets.** Because a broken feature contract degrades rather
    than fails ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)), the runtime cannot be the thing that catches
    it — a mis-built pack would ship and silently rank by `static_order`. What validates descriptor
    sets in CI, what does it check (hash agreement, KMD pairing, signature resolvability, knob-tuple
    uniqueness), and does it run per-provider or centrally over all shipped packs?
    *(Impacts [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement), [Section 12](#12-observability).)*

15. **The expression-language reference.** The descriptor expression language is specified in its own
    RFC, which is deferred and not yet written, so this document states the language's properties
    ([Section 6.2](#62-the-features_signature)) without being able to cite its sections. Two things
    settle when it lands: the normative operator list this RFC recaps, and whether the custom-operation
    hook arrives, which fixes the boundary at which a compiled scorer takes over
    ([Section 7](#7-model-adapters)). Until then, the operator set recapped here is the working contract.
    *(Impacts [Section 6.2](#62-the-features_signature), [Section 7](#7-model-adapters).)*

16. **Out-of-distribution detection — partially resolved.** Training-arch coverage now rides in the
    model artifact and is checked at runtime: a model declares the architectures it was trained on, and
    an unseen one withholds the estimate and degrades the ranking
    ([Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs)). The per-candidate axis is resolved the same way
    [Section 5](#5-selection-flow) assumes — a candidate whose recovered score is non-finite or
    non-positive is distrusted individually, ordered last, and reported as 0, with one diagnostic
    carrying the affected and total counts for the request. What remains open is the *continuous* case:
    whether per-feature training ranges ship alongside the arch list, and what a row outside them costs.
    Deciding that before more artifact fields land keeps it additive.
    *(Impacts [Section 8.3](#83-out-of-distribution-inputs), [Section 7.2](#72-default-tree_data).)*

17. **Categorical ordering semantics.** Integer codes imply an order a tree model will split on
    (`dtype < 2`), which is meaningless for an unordered category
    ([Section 6.5](#65-categorical-encoding)). Standardize per-field: assign codes in a deliberately
    meaningful order where one exists (dtype by byte width), one-hot where none does, or let the author
    declare which. Decide before the first real model, since changing it later is a retrain.
    *(Impacts [Section 6.5](#65-categorical-encoding).)*

18. **Knob-set stability vs. model churn — RESOLVED.** `UED.knobs` is the engine's **public tuning
    surface**, authored by the engine, and the UHD's `$kernel.*` feature set is a subset of it
    ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes),
    [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)). A training run does not reshape it: a retrain that drops
    `split_k` as a feature leaves the knob declared, because the engine's UMDs and its callers read that
    list and a model has no standing to withdraw a dial from them. The asymmetry is the whole content of
    the rule — a model ranking on an axis the UED never exposed is a load error, because the caller
    cannot vary what selection depends on; a knob no model reads is a warning, and is the expected state
    for a knob whose training column carried one value. Removing a knob is therefore an engine-authoring
    decision, taken deliberately and stamped as a breaking content revision
    ([Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling)), not a side effect of feature selection.
    Sub-question (b) resolves with it: an engine with no UHD exposes its authored `knobs` exactly as one
    with a UHD does, and a caller can pin a kernel on a pack that has never been benchmarked.
    *(Impacts [Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes), [Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement), [Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling).)*

19. **Validating the training oracle.** A timing becomes a training label only after the candidate is
    shown correct ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)), which leaves two questions.
    (a) **What reference?** Options are a CPU reference executor, a trusted in-catalog kernel, or a
    cross-engine result; each differs in cost and in what it can certify, and the choice may be per op.
    (b) **Is matcher coverage checked?** An over-narrow matcher silently omits candidates, so a problem
    can produce a plausible-looking but impoverished candidate set. Generation could flag a problem whose
    candidate count is anomalous for its cohort, but distinguishing "correctly narrow" from "wrongly
    narrow" needs a definition of expected coverage this RFC does not have.
    *(Impacts [Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli), [Section 13.3](#133-one-source-of-truth-translated-once).)*

### Ranking Metrics

20. **What an accuracy metric measures.** Accuracy is comparable across engines only when two engines
    are measured against the same reference with the same statistic: maximum relative error, ULP
    distance, or a pass rate at a stated tolerance are three different quantities. The registry therefore
    reserves `accuracy.*` and registers each definition by name ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics)).
    Open: which definitions, against which reference — the same question as
    [Open Question 19](#operational)(a), and settled with it — and whether one reference serves every op.
    *(Impacts [Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics).)*

21. **The quick policy's winner configuration.** The quick policy never evaluates B to *rank*
    ([Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007)). Before metrics, it did evaluate the
    **winner's** B once, to report that engine's configuration in the heuristic result. The options:
    (a) keep that single evaluation, so the result names a tuned configuration at the cost of one B per
    selection; (b) drop it, so the quick policy never evaluates B at all and the kernel is chosen at plan
    build by the metric's ranker ([Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric)) — paid once, for the
    engine actually built. Recommendation: (b). It keeps the policy's cost bounded by the L1 models alone,
    and the choice is not lost but moved to where it is needed; it makes carrying the metric to plan build
    a requirement rather than a refinement.
    *(Impacts [Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007), [Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric).)*

22. **Constraints alongside the ranking metric.** A request ranks by one metric. A common need is a
    ranking in one metric subject to a bound in another — the fastest engine whose error is at most
    `1e-3`. The request surface names a single metric today; growing it into `{objective metric,
    constraints[]}` is additive, and a constraint would be answered by the same per-metric queries,
    with an engine unable to answer a constraint treated as unscored. Deferred until an accuracy metric is
    registered ([Open Question 20](#ranking-metrics)).
    *(Impacts [Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007), [Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric).)*

## 18. Glossary

- **UHD (Universal Heuristic Descriptor):** A kernel-selection model. An engine names UHDs in up to three
  roles, arch-keyed and — for the two scoring roles — one per ranking metric
  ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)): `sort_kernel_catalog` (ranks the
  catalog — the main one, and what unqualified "UHD" means here), `predict_engine` (a cheap
  engine-level estimate), and the future `predict_applicable_kernels` (candidate generator). Each is
  per-engine and arch-aware (takes `$device.*`), composed of a **universal header** (identity, feature
  contract, objective) and an **adapter-scoped body** ([Section 4.1](#41-field-reference-normative)).

- **Ranking metric:** The quantity a UHD's score estimates and a request ranks by — `tflops` by default,
  `time`, and reserved `accuracy.*` definitions. A closed registry fixes each metric's units and winning
  direction; a UHD names its metric in `score.metric`, and a request names the metric it wants
  ([Section 4.4](#44-ranking-metrics), [Section 11.4](#114-selecting-a-uhd-by-metric)).

- **Catalog:** The set of an engine's kernels that pass every matcher for one graph — engine-scoped, the
  union across every KDP joining that engine ([RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md)). The
  pipeline's initial candidate set. Determined by the **matcher**, before any UHD is loaded.

- **KDP (Kernel Descriptor Pack):** The pack that joins an engine and adds kernels; names one matcher
  set, one UED (which carries the UHD and KMD), and one UDD over a vector of child UKDs. The selection
  group is a pack's child kernels; the selector and metadata schema come from the engine.

- **KMD (Kernel Metadata Descriptor):** [RFC 0017](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md)'s explicit,
  upfront declaration of the engine's **compilation knobs** — the variant `fields` (`tile_m`, `split_k`,
  `dtype`, …) every kernel carries, each with a type and optional default. **One KMD per engine, owned
  by the UED**; each UKD's `metadata` fills it. It is the authoritative schema for the `$kernel.*` fields
  the UHD ranks on and the `features_signature` references
  ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)).

- **UED (Universal Engine Descriptor):** The UED names one KMD and, optionally, its role-scoped
  arch-keyed UHDs ([Section 3.1](#31-descriptor-relationships)). It also owns `graph_match`, which
  publishes the symbol table the features read
  ([RFC 0020 §6](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md#6-symbol-binding-what-the-pattern-publishes)). KMD
  and UHD are coupled — the KMD is the feature space the ranker ranks over — so the engine owns both; a
  *breaking* KMD change requires retraining, while additive changes and dispatch-only fields do not
  ([Section 3.3](#33-coupling-rules)).

- **`global.` knobs:** hipDNN's reserved knob namespace ([RFC 0004](0004_EngineConfigKnobs.md)), which a
  descriptor-backed engine implements like any other engine. Per
  [RFC 0020 §5](0020_UniversalEngineDescriptor.md) it is **separate from** the UED's `knobs` list and the
  two do not overlap — so `global.` knobs are not KMD fields and are not part of the UHD's feature space.

- **Knob:** A **KMD field the engine exposes for a caller to pin**, named in the UED's `knobs` (the KMD
  already declares its type and default). `UED.knobs` is the engine's public tuning surface and a
  **superset** of the `$kernel.*` fields the UHD reads: every axis the model ranks on must be exposed,
  and a knob the model does not read stays declared because callers and the engine's UMDs depend on it.
  A knob's legal values come from the *catalog* for this graph, and its **default is whatever the UHD
  ranks first**. Knobs *filter* the catalog; the UHD then ranks what survives
  ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)).

- **Knob tuple:** The values of an engine's knobs for one kernel — the kernel's projection onto the
  axes an outside caller can name. Narrower than the **metadata tuple**, which covers every KMD field
  and is unique engine-wide. Two kernels differing only in **dispatch-only** fields (KMD fields that
  are not knobs, read by a UDD) share a knob tuple, score identically, and are separated by the
  deterministic tie-break — legal, but warned about at load
  ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)). Note also that the
  *cross-product* of legal knob values is not the set of legal tuples: most combinations match no
  kernel, which is why the catalog is enumerated directly rather than reconstructed from knob ranges
  ([Section 13.2](#132-benchmarking-via-the-hipdnn-bench-cli)).

- **Benchmark wide, expose what the caller needs:** Generate against a UED exposing every addressable
  KMD field — so every kernel is individually timeable — then let feature selection prune the axes that
  do not earn their place in the *model*. The emitted UED's `knobs` are the engine's authored public
  surface, which the trained feature set must be contained in rather than replace
  ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes),
  [Section 14.4](#144-pipeline-knob-reduction-hipdnn-jit-case)).

- **`categorical_encoding`:** The map from a string KMD field's values to numeric codes, generated by
  the tooling from the values observed during training and shipped in the UHD. Part of the resolved
  feature contract, so `features_hash` covers it; an unseen value at runtime is an out-of-distribution
  signal, not an error ([Section 6.5](#65-categorical-encoding)).

- **`trained_against`:** The UED, UMD, and KMD **content revisions** a heuristic was generated against,
  each recorded as `{id, revision}` and the UMD entry as a list, since an engine's catalog can span
  several independently revised matchers. Checked at load (breaking `==`, additive `<=`) to disable a
  model whose descriptors have moved under it. A content revision is a separate axis from the
  file-format `version` the accept rule gates on
  ([Section 8.1](#81-descriptor-versions-and-uhd-coupling)).

- **Dispatch-only field:** A KMD field that is *not* a knob, and therefore not in the UHD's feature set —
  launch geometry or workspace detail a UDD consumes. Invisible to selection
  ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)).

- **KMD field space:** The engine's variant axes (`tile_m`, `warp_n`, `split_k`), filled per-kernel in
  UKD `metadata` — the space the UHD ranks over, read as `$kernel.*`. Each UKD is one point in it; the
  KDP is the collection. Knobs are a user-facing *subset* of these fields, not a separate category
  ([Section 3.2](#32-kmd-fields-and-knobs-as-the-heuristics-feature-axes)).

- **Kernel-selection heuristic vs. engine-selection heuristic:** The two levels; the UHD is the former
  (which kernel within an engine), [RFC 0007](0007_EngineSelectionHeuristicsFramework.md) owns the
  latter (which engine).

- **`features_signature`:** The UHD's ordered, versioned list of model inputs (bare `$`-prefixed fields
  or expressions) that both training and inference consume through one generic extractor; the contract
  that must stay bit-identical across the two. Fingerprinted by `features_hash` **together with the
  the `categorical_encoding` it uses** ([Section 6.3](#63-contract-enforcement)); because computed
  features are inline, the signature is itself the computation.

- **Computed feature:** A `features_signature` entry that is an expression rather than a bare `$` token.
  Written **inline**; there is no `$derived.*` namespace and no named-value block. Repetition is free
  because the signature compiles once and the evaluator hash-conses identical subtrees
  ([Section 6.4](#64-computed-features)).

- **`native`:** The bootstrap adapter — a scorer compiled into the engine and named in the UHD by symbol.
  Lands first because it needs no format, parser, or extractor, and serves as the performance baseline.
  Not a drop-in: changing it means recompiling the engine ([Section 7.1](#71-first-native)).

- **`tree_data`:** The default shipping path — a GBDT tree table shipped as data with the engine's
  descriptor set and evaluated by an in-tree GBDT walker written for this work; standalone drop-in, zero
  runtime dependency.

- **`custom_library`:** The drop-in escape hatch — a compiled scorer `.so` shipped with the engine and
  `dlopen`'d through a tiny C ABI; standalone, any model family, gated on the trust audit. Distinct from
  `native`, which is compiled *into* the engine and needs no loading or trust boundary.

- **Scorer / adapter:** The thing that turns a UHD's model content into a per-candidate score; reached
  through an adapter in build-and-runtime (default) or build-only delivery classes, mirroring
  [RFC 0017 §9](0017_UniversalKernelDescriptor.md#9-adapters-and-extensibility).

- **The tooling:** The heuristic-generation pipeline this RFC builds on — a sweep step that produces a
  training dataset (problem × kernel × measured TFLOPS), a training step that fits a LightGBM regressor on
  `log1p(tflops)`, an exporter, and a dispatcher path, first exercised on SDPA/FMHA forward and reusable
  by any package author ([Section 13](#13-model-generation-pipeline)). Two properties shape this design:
  shipping the model as data is what makes a heuristic drop-in, and the feature vector is the failure-prone
  contract, so generating it from one specification keeps training and inference consistent.

- **`lgbm_to_c`:** The tooling's build-only path that lowers a LightGBM booster to C linked into the
  provider. Kept only as an optional build-time perf optimization for in-tree AOT models — **not** a
  drop-in shipping mechanism.

- **Score-only mode:** Running a UHD to obtain the best predicted score without selecting for launch;
  the hook for surfacing an estimate in the requested ranking metric to engine selection.

- **Stage P (package):** The pipeline stage that emits the engine descriptor set (UED/UHD/KMD +
  tree-table) from the same sweep that trained the model, enforcing the feature and kernel-identity
  contracts ([Section 13](#13-model-generation-pipeline)).

- **Engine estimate (A, L1):** Cheap `f(graph) → expected metric value` model, one per ranking metric,
  and the only estimate the quick policy consults. Not required for v1; it applies once there are
  competing engines to order, or opaque engines with no catalog to rank
  ([Section 11.1](#111-the-engine-estimate-and-the-kernel-catalog-ranker)).

- **Config UHD (B, L2):** Full `f(graph) → best kernel + predicted metric value` model, one per ranking
  metric, for kernel selection and accurate cross-engine comparison. The thorough policy's first choice,
  falling back to A; never consulted by the quick policy
  ([Section 11.2](#112-two-engine-selection-policies-rfc-0007)).
