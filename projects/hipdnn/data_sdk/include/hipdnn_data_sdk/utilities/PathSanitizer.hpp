/// Sanitizes @p raw into a single path component safe to use as a directory or file name
/// component on Linux and Windows alike.
///
/// The result is always `<sanitized stem>-<fixed-width hash of raw>`. The hash suffix is a
/// 64-bit FNV-1a digest of the whole, untruncated @p raw (the stem it sits beside is lossy
/// and truncated, but the hash is not), so two distinct inputs collide only on a 64-bit
/// FNV-1a collision -- on the order of 2^-64 per pair -- without needing a registry of
/// names seen so far.
///
/// The stem keeps only printable ASCII. Control bytes (NUL included -- a NUL would
/// truncate the component at the C-string boundary and drop the hash suffix with it) and
/// non-ASCII bytes are both replaced, the latter because the stem is capped by BYTE
/// count while MSVC reads a narrow path as UTF-8: keeping them would let the cap split a
/// multibyte sequence and hand path conversion half a codepoint. It also handles the
/// colon (illegal on Windows), Windows-reserved device names (CON, PRN, COM1-9, LPT1-9,
/// matched case-insensitively against the part before the first dot, which is where
/// Windows resolves a device alias), leading/trailing dots (stripped -- a lone leading
/// dot makes a Unix dotfile, a trailing one is dropped by some Windows APIs), and an
/// overall length cap so stem plus hash stay within a filesystem's component limit.
///
/// A non-ASCII name therefore sanitizes to underscores plus its hash: still distinct and
/// still safe, but no longer human-readable. hipDNN's engine names are ASCII identifiers.
///
/// @param raw May be empty; every std::string_view is a valid input.
/// @return A single, non-empty path component safe on Linux and Windows. Never throws.
