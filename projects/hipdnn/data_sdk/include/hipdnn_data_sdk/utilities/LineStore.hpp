// LineStore is a generic, record-format-agnostic append-only shard file: a bare version
// string on the first line, followed by caller-defined record lines, one per line. It
// treats every line after the first as opaque text and hands parsing/formatting to the
// caller via a callback -- this header must never depend on nlohmann/json or any other
// JSON type; JSON-record callers supply their own encode/decode.
//
// Concurrency. A shard is guarded by two locks that are always taken in the same order:
// an in-process mutex first, then the OS file lock. Both are owned by one registry entry
// per shard, identified by (device, inode) rather than by path, so two names for one file
// -- a symlink, a bind mount, an NFS alias -- share a single entry.
//
// The registry exists because POSIX fcntl locks are a property of the (process, inode)
// pair, not of a descriptor: a second descriptor on the same file does not block against
// its own process, and closing ANY descriptor for that file, or releasing through it,
// drops every lock the process holds on it. Handing every caller its own descriptor
// therefore lets one thread silently strip a lock another thread believes it is holding.
// The registry keeps exactly one descriptor per shard and never closes it, and the mutex
// makes the threads of a process queue before they reach the file lock at all. Win32
// LockFileEx is per-HANDLE and mandatory rather than advisory, so it does not have the
// POSIX failure mode, but the same structure is used on both platforms so that the two
// mean the same thing.
//
// The in-process mutex is held exclusively even for a read. The threads of one process
// share the entry's single descriptor, and with it one file offset, so two concurrent
// reads would interleave their seek-then-read pairs and each get missing or duplicated
// bytes. A POSIX read lock is per (process, inode) as well, so the first reader to
// finish would release the lock every other reader still relies on. Reads are rare and a
// shard is small, so the mutex serializes them instead of counting them.
//
// One shard at a time. Each registry entry owns an independent mutex, so two threads
// that take shards A then B and B then A deadlock. No in-tree path holds one shard while
// opening or locking another; a caller that needs two at once must impose its own order.
//
// Nesting is handled by the registry rather than by caller discipline. Both lock modes
// cover the whole file, so a shared acquisition nested inside an exclusive one is a
// POSIX lock *conversion* -- the exclusive lock is replaced, and the inner release then
// drops it outright, mid-critical-section -- and on Win32 a legal same-handle overlap
// whose first release frees the exclusive lock. Either way the outer writer would lose
// exclusivity. The registry therefore tracks each THREAD's nesting depth and makes an
// inner shared acquisition a no-op, so readAllLines() is safe to call whether or not the
// caller already holds the shard exclusively.
//
// Adapted from miopen::LockFile (projects/miopen/src/include/miopen/lock_file.hpp and
// file_lock.hpp), which solves the same problem, with four deliberate differences: it
// keys its registry on the path rather than on (device, inode); it never states the
// never-close rule, getting it only because its map is never erased; its lock() takes the
// mutex and the file lock simultaneously via std::lock rather than in a fixed order; and
// its timed acquisitions leak the mutex on timeout. This header also reports failure
// through status codes instead of exceptions, and needs the nesting rule above, which
// MIOpen never hits because nothing re-enters LockFile under its own lock.
//
// Failure handling is fail-soft: open/lock/read failures and version mismatches are
// reported through the return value, never an exception. A line the caller's parse
// callback rejects is skipped without affecting any other line. Resolving duplicate-keyed
// records (e.g. last-line-wins) is the caller's job.
