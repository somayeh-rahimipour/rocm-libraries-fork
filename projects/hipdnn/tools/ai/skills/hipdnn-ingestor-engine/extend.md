# Extension contract

[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) owns execution. This page defines what an addition may change
and what it must preserve.

## Identity and scope

The baseline inventory is the known-good installation plus the complete engine tree:
UED, referenced KMD, dispatch, optional heuristic, shared/per-pack matchers, KDPs and
inline/standalone UKDs. Resolve by UUID, not filename — pointwise ADD/MUL/SUB share a
KMD whose filename does not follow the individual packs.

Preserve old names, UUIDs, symbols, references and native hooks; only genuinely new
objects get new IDs. Compare completed, KMD-typed metadata across the whole engine:
conflicting tuples on overlapping effective architectures fail, equal tuples on disjoint
architectures are legal. New topology, layouts, attributes or feature combinations
reopen [graph-contract.md](graph-contract.md), even for a "variant".

A new variant can be one added KDP entry or a standalone UKD reference, with no new
engine-level objects. A new pack adds its KDP and a genuine pack-specific criterion. The
generator requires a discriminator for every pack when an engine becomes multi-pack;
retain existing engine-wide identities and hooks.

## Addition-only splicing

The generator has no incremental mode. Scratch generation emits engine-level identities
too, and `--force` against a live tree can replace shared objects and hand-filled
bodies. An extension therefore copies only reviewed additions and explicitly changed
references, never the whole scratch tree or an entire CMake list.

Every scratch reference to an existing UED/KMD/UDD/UHD/shared matcher must use the real
retained UUID, as must consumer IDs in the enclosing KDP's
`provenance.specialization_contract` and any per-UKD override. A standalone UKD carries
its own declaration. Do not overwrite a live shared descriptor because scratch
generation emitted one.

Append new entries to an existing KDP without dropping its siblings. Packaged changes
enter the authored production source root and are repacked; a packed descriptor cannot
be edited and paired with its old descriptor/schema/arch/payload-bound evidence. A new
pack under an existing engine reuses its engine registration row and appends only
required source/test/registration work. The selected-path placeholder check and all
splice commands are in RUNBOOK stage 3.

## Authoring a direct-load bundle

**Descriptors get no registration, because there is none.** The packer walks a
`SOURCE_ROOT` recursively and no descriptor is named in CMake, so adding one is dropping
files in a folder — `test_descriptors/<set>/<slug>/` for a test bundle,
`descriptors/<producer>/<bundle>/` for a shipped one. The set is the whole mechanism:
each is a separate pack target walked by directory, so a bundle written into the wrong
set installs cleanly and is then invisible to the binary meant to read it.

Two packer rules govern what that walk accepts:

- **Hidden paths are skipped, with a warning.** Any dot-prefixed path segment or
  filename is warned and skipped, as is a `*.json` whose name carries no type token, so
  an incidental file or a `.git/` under a user-supplied root is tolerated rather than
  aborting the pack. The production content gate applies the same rule, so a KDP under a
  hidden path does not wire packaging.
- **An `embedded_source` `source_file` must be able to act as an identity.** It is never
  normalised, so a `..` segment is rejected (one file would take two identities) and an
  absolute path is rejected (the emitted key must be the same on every machine). Write
  it relative to the descriptor's own folder, for example `kernels/MyKernel.cpp`.

The one registration a generated engine needs is the **kernel source**, and only for
`kernel_source.kind == "embedded_source"`:

| Group | Kinds | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Compilation inputs | `hip`, `rocke` | Authored, lowered to a code object at pack time. No CMake registration. |
| Prebuilt input | `hsaco` | Authored as `{file, symbol}`, packed byte-for-byte: no compile, no CMake registration. `arch` is mandatory: list every arch the object runs on (a generic-target object lists all of them), on the kernel or inherited from its pack. |
| Passthrough | `embedded_source` | Shipped as authored, no producer runs, no archive entry. **Needs the registration below.** |
| Runtime descriptor form | `kpack` | Written *by* the packer and shipped; the runtime sees only this. The packer's intermediate also uses `kind: hsaco` for compiled variants. |

```cmake
# In P/src/tests/CMakeLists.txt, beside base's existing calls. Required ONLY for
# kernel_source.kind == "embedded_source": that kind resolves source_file against a
# key table the build compiles into the binary.
set(_my_kernel_dir "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../engines/kernel_ingestor_engine/test_descriptors/<set>/<slug>/kernels")
add_kernels_for_embedding(
    TARGET hip_kernel_provider_tests
    FILES "${_my_kernel_dir}/MyKernel.cpp"
    KEYS  kernels/MyKernel.cpp)
```

Each `KEYS` entry must equal the `source_file` string the descriptor authors, because
`hkp_verify_embedded_sources` compares staged descriptors against exactly this manifest.
The runtime reads `source_file` as a key into that table and opens no file for this
kind; the packer copies none of these sources into the staged tree.

## Addition-specific evidence

Whole-engine checks cover shared KMDs and unchanged variants plus the new inventory. An
addition whose suite is censused must run its
`hip-kernel-provider-hkp-census-<arch>-<suite>` entry for **every** arch that suite is
registered at: the owning pack target's wired arches, narrowed by the call's `ARCHES`
when it names any. The entry runs `hip_kernel_provider_census_tests`, the binary census
suites are compiled into. An addition under an uncensused suite states its inventory
through that suite's ordinary host run. [native-pack.md](native-pack.md) owns
eligibility. Device proof must explicitly select and numerically verify the new
candidate; passing the unchanged default is not extension acceptance.

The handoff identifies retained IDs/references, changed/new files, baseline/final
installations, whole-engine results and the addition's actual dispatch. RUNBOOK stage 5
contains the bounded HALF/256 pointwise example; its one-element source is not
arbitrary-size pointwise coverage.
