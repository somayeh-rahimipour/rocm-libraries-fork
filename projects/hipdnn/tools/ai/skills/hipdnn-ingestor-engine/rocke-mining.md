# Kernel contracts: applicability, specialization and launch

Current builder/dispatcher source and library documentation outrank historical examples.
For direct-load HIP, extract the same semantic/launch facts from HIP; do not invent a
rocKE builder or profile. [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) owns execution.

## Source evidence

| Source | Required facts |
|---|---|
| Builder and annotated dataclass | `(spec, *, arch)` interface, required fields and defaults |
| Constructor, validators, support predicate | Rejections and architecture restrictions |
| Memory arithmetic | Baked strides, bounds, loop counts and operand layouts |
| Dispatch factory | Request fields, constants and derived baseline choices |
| Geometry/signature helpers | Grid/block formulas, deciding fields, ordered ABI and guards |
| Launch wrapper | Shape/feature checks absent from construction |
| Documentation, history and benchmarks | Measured knob hypotheses and numerical limits |

Follow helpers actually consumed by the builder; do not guess naming conventions. An
empty introspection arch list means unknown, not unsupported. Constructor-valid does not
imply supported: the real predicate must accept each **final** overridden or promoted
spec, including isolation and shipping crosses. API failures are not shape declines.
Read [graph-contract.md](graph-contract.md) for graph-only features and fused edges
absent from the kernel's Python surface.

## Applicability classification

- **Graph-only:** reject in `graph_match` when no candidate can serve it.
- **Graph versus baked value:** compare in `kernel_match`, using equality for an
  extent/trip count and a proven inequality for capacity. Silent zero-fill or truncation
  is not support.
- **Knob-dependent:** test against each candidate — e.g. sequence divisibility by its
  tile — rather than imposing a fixed engine-wide constraint.
- **Spec-internal:** enforce relations between tuning fields in final-spec support
  checks, not a graph matcher.
- **Excluded semantic feature:** enforce the approved exclusion; do not imply its
  sub-rules are implemented.
- **Unrepresentable feature:** investigate semantic equivalents and composition, then
  report the missing mechanism and scope decision rather than silently enabling it.

Metadata used by scoring, geometry or workspace is required even without a graph
comparison. Enumerate every downstream consumer.

## Authored intent and compiler evidence

The generator reference owns the declaration format: its **Specialization agreement**
section, documented from the repository root in
`projects/hipdnn/tools/IngestorGenerator/README.md` (RUNBOOK's `$GEN/README.md`). Locate
that section by heading, not by link fragment. The generator carries
`provenance.specialization_contract` **once on each enclosing KDP**. Inline UKDs inherit
it only when they have no own declaration; a per-UKD declaration overrides
**wholesale**, never merges. Standalone UKDs carry their own. The rule is identical for
authored and packed trees; packaging takes no separate profile list or root manifest.

Every KMD field belongs to the exhaustive, disjoint specialization/matcher-only
partition. Each specialization binding names exactly one direct `field` or
zero-argument `method` on the actual hydrated object passed to the builder. A direct
field is authoritative only if the builder consumes it without further resolution; bind
an effective accessor even when its raw field is non-null. Retain builder use sites for
each binding and exemption, independently reviewed; a mechanically complete partition
cannot justify relabeling causal or swizzle as matcher-only.

For gfx942 dense, the builder consumes `resolved_use_exp2_fast()`,
`resolved_use_cfvst()`, `resolved_v_row_pad()` and `resolved_use_v_swizzle()`. Raw
swizzle=true can still resolve false with cfvst disabled. Do not copy policy formulas or
guess a `resolved_<name>` accessor.

Keep authored omission/`None` intent in `provenance.spec`. Compilation observes real
constructor defaults/default factories and effective accessors. Unresolved `None`,
missing readouts, unsupported types, exceptions or non-repeatable resolution block
agreement; they are not wildcards. KMD completion preserves BOOL, deliberately projects
an observed builder boolean to 0/1 for INT, and canonicalizes FLOAT.

Compiler-owned `provenance.effective_spec` is **per-kernel and never inherited**. It
binds observations and producer origins to the current descriptor, schema, metadata,
arch and payload; authored input cannot supply or overwrite it. Serial, prewarm and
shared compile results must check every consumer independently. Full verification reads
that record without importing today's producer.

A packed kernel that declares no specialized `metadata_fields` and carries no
`effective_spec` resolves by producer origin, per RUNBOOK stage 4: `rocke` is a hard
failure of full verification, while an absent `origin_kind`, `"hip"` or `"hsaco"` is
`NOT VERIFIED HERE`. An absent `origin_kind` is **not** rocKE — descriptors packed
before the field existed, and hand-authored inputs, carry none.

These checks do not prove native dispatch or arbitrary machine-code correctness.

## Layout, geometry and ABI

Derive operand address formulas independently. `((b*S+s)*H+h)*D+d` describes token-major
BSHD memory even with logical dims `[B,H,S,D]`. A kernel without stride arguments cannot
honor arbitrary strides; extent-one axes are the exception. Do not infer V/output width
or layout from Q.

Record every grid/block branch and workspace formula, resolved constants and deciding
KMD fields. Wrong geometry can leave output unwritten without raising an error. Output
checks belong at matching when available, otherwise at preparation.

Every pointer slot needs a graph UID, workspace or synthesized-buffer source, lifetime
and enforced assumptions. Synthesizing lengths from dims assumes uniform lengths and is
not varlen support. For a **conditional ABI**, C++ must replay presence guards and exact
order/types. For a **fixed ABI**, disabled features leave their slots in place; omitting
an unused argument shifts everything after it.

The dispatcher defines the provisional baseline. Legal knob values and historical
benchmarks are hypotheses, not shipping evidence. Policy omission versus explicit false
can change binaries even when displayed metadata and counts agree. Retain restriction
dispositions, layouts, graph mappings, geometry/workspace, ABI and binding use sites;
unresolved correctness questions block the affected path.
