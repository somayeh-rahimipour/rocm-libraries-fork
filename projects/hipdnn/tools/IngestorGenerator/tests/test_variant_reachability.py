"""The converse of the desk check: can any graph SELECT this variant?

The desk check and the variant-set gate both ask whether a shipped variant matches a
graph and whether the set is internally consistent. Backwards is where dead weight
hides: when every shipped shape is divisible by the wider of two tiles, both are always
APPLICABLE, the scorer picks the wider one, and half the set can be selected by no
graph while the suite stays green. Applicability in the real engine is
`seqlen_kv % block_n == 0`, not equality, so both shipped tiles are legal at once.
