"""What `dispatch_parity.py` reports, and what it refuses to report.

A shape that is not served has exactly ONE per-shape explanation: the eligibility
predicate ran, returned false, and gave a reason. Spec construction failing aborts the
command instead, because a corpus the request class cannot hydrate makes every
remaining count untrustworthy, and a `rejected` bucket that can only print 0 claims a
failure was checked for. The dispatcher, request class and predicate are stubs.

Also what the tool BINDS before it can report anything: where a profile's
``provider_root`` resolves from, and which dispatch arm the shipped profile pins.
