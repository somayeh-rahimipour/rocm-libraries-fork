"""Three rungs, three questions. A count answers none of them.

A descriptor count can be exactly right while nothing reaches a GPU: one duplicate
catalog tuple makes the loader reject the whole engine and the phase still exits 0. The
property under test is that each rung stays separable, and that a rung which cannot run
reports NOT RUN and fails rather than being skipped into a pass.

The end-to-end class needs a validator and a profile named in the environment and skips
otherwise; the rung-separation tests need neither, so the property is checked on every
machine.
