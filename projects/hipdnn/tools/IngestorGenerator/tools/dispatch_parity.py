"""Generate the variant set rocKE's own dispatcher would resolve.

Stage 1 of an integration, and the only configuration argued from rocKE's
behaviour rather than from measurement: the validators, the spec dataclass and
the ``supports_*`` predicate answer what is legal, the dispatcher answers what
the library ships. Calling the factory applies rules the dispatcher derives
from the request (``persistent = work >= num_persistent``).

Emits one variant per servable shape, at the dispatcher's resolved spec, as a
generator config ready for ``generate.py``. Not a cross-product: one spec per
shape.

    dispatch_parity.py --profile <profile.yaml> --shapes <corpus.json> \\
                       --out configs/<slug>_A.yaml

A request-construction failure means the corpus and the request class disagree
about what a shape is, so it aborts (``ParityError``, ``FAIL`` on stderr, exit
2). A decline -- the eligibility predicate returning false with a reason -- is
a per-shape outcome, counted and printed by ``--report-gaps``.

This tool does not sweep. ``--report-knobs`` partitions the spec fields into
those that vary across dispatch decisions and those the library ships (see
``knob_partition``).
