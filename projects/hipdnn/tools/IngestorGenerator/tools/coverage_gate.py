"""Three checks that answer three different questions; a descriptor count
answers none of them.

  1. STATIC -- do the descriptors describe what they claim?
     (`verify_variant_sets.py`.) Runs anywhere, no build and no rocKE.
     `--mode` picks which claim is made and has no default.
  2. LOADS  -- does the engine survive the loader's own rules?
     (`hipdnn_validate_descriptors`.) Needs a build, no GPU; the only cheap
     rung that catches an engine dropped for a duplicate catalog tuple.
  3. SERVES -- does it serve graphs on a device, and how many? Needs a GPU.

This tool runs 1 and 2 and reports 3's requirement explicitly.

                     --profile <profile.yaml> \\

                     --expect-engine hipkernel:Gfx942AttentionDense

Rung 2 and `--mode full` want the packed tree: `hkp_pack` lowers a
`kind: rocke` descriptor to `kind: kpack` at build time, and the runtime
loader rejects `builder` as an unknown key.
