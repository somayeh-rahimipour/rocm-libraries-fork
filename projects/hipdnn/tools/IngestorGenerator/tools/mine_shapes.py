"""Build the shape corpus the dispatcher resolves (RUNBOOK §2's corpus).

Three sources answer three different questions, and none is sufficient alone:

  * the kernel team's published results CSV -- shapes already resolved, with
    priority and ticket group attached. Ask for it before mining anything.
  * dnn-benchmarking's graph corpus -- what real callers ask for.
  * the kernel's own `supports_*` predicate -- what is legal to build.

Kernel-side sources answer what is legal; the first two answer what anyone
asks for. Every emitted shape carries its provenance so a result can be split
by source; a `microbench/` path is a provenance label, not a synthetic-data
warning.

    mine_shapes.py --published <csv> --arch gfx942 --out shapes.json

Emits the request-field mappings `dispatch_parity.py --shapes` consumes, and
does not filter by what the kernel can serve: the dispatcher reports declines
with reasons, and filtering here would hide the gap this corpus measures.
