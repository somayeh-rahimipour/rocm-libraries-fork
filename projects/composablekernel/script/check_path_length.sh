# Rejects paths that are long enough to break a Windows build.
#
# Windows resolves paths against a classic MAX_PATH of 260 characters. Some
# build tools -- notably ninja's Stat() when it re-generates build.ninja -- do
# not honour the LongPathsEnabled registry setting, so a source file whose
# absolute path exceeds 260 characters fails the build outright:
#
#   ninja: error: rebuilding 'build.ninja': Stat(C:\...\device_grouped_conv2d_
#   fwd_bias_bn_clamp_xdl_nhwgc_gkyxc_nhwgk_bf16_comp_2x_instance.in):
#   Filename longer than 260 characters
#
# The absolute path is the checkout prefix plus the repository-relative path.
# Only the second half is ours to control, so that is what this check bounds:
#
#   limit = MAX_PATH(260) - checkout prefix budget(60) = 200 characters
#
# The 60-character budget is the prefix used by the Windows nightly CI that
# first hit this (C:\actions-runner\_work\rocm-npi-dev\therock\rocm-libraries\),
# so a path that passes this check builds on Windows anywhere that prefix fits.
#
# A second, independent limit rejects individual file names over NAME_MAX(255),
# which no common filesystem (ext4, NTFS, APFS) can store at all.
#
# Used both by the Jenkinsfile "Static Checks" stage -- where it is fed the
# files a pull request adds or modifies, so pre-existing long paths do not
# block unrelated work -- and by developers locally:
#
#   git ls-files | xargs script/check_path_length.sh   # audit the whole tree
#
# Paths may be given relative to the repository root or to the current
# directory; both are normalised to repository-relative before measuring.
#
# Usage: ./check_path_length.sh <file1> <file2> ...
#
# Overrides (all optional):
#   CK_MAX_PATH_TOTAL   total path budget                      (default 260)
#   CK_PREFIX_BUDGET    characters reserved for the checkout   (default 60)
#   CK_MAX_PATH_LEN     repo-relative limit, overrides the two above
#   CK_MAX_NAME_LEN     single file name limit                 (default 255)
