# rocALUTION Testing Strategy

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** @doctorcolinsmith
**Technical Lead:** @ntrost57
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-10

This document describes how rocALUTION is tested today, which signals actually gate a merge, and where
the gaps are. It follows the ROCm-wide TESTING.md template and is written as a description of the
current state rather than an aspirational one. A gap that is written down is one that can be argued
about and closed.

---

## Component Overview

rocALUTION is a sparse linear algebra library for **iterative solvers and preconditioners**, built in
C++ and HIP with a portable, backend-agnostic design. It provides Krylov solvers,
direct solvers, algebraic multigrid, and a large family of preconditioners on top of the ROCm mathematics
stack.

**Where it sits in the ROCm stack:** it is an Expansion-SDK-level solver library. When GPU support is
enabled it links against **rocSPARSE**, **rocBLAS**, **rocPRIM**, and **rocRAND**
(package minimums: `rocsparse >= 1.12.10`, `rocblas >= 2.22.0`, `rocrand >= 2.1.0`,
`hip-runtime-amd >= 4.5.0`).

**Backends (selectable at configuration time):**

| Backend | Flag | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Host | Always built | `src/base/host/` |
| OpenMP | `SUPPORT_OMP` (default ON if found) | Multi-threaded host |
| HIP / GPU | `SUPPORT_HIP` (default ON if found) | `src/base/hip/`; initializes rocBLAS/rocSPARSE |
| MPI / multi-node | `SUPPORT_MPI` (default OFF) | Compiles def `SUPPORT_MULTINODE`, links `MPI::MPI_CXX` |

**Key architectural constraint that shapes testing:** rocALUTION runs the *same* solver/preconditioner
algorithms across host, OpenMP, and HIP backends. Correctness is therefore validated by running each
algorithm on each available backend and cross-checking, which makes the suite backend-parameterized
rather than GPU-specific. Much of the solver logic *can* run on the host backend without a GPU, but the
GPU paths and the low-level `local_matrix`/`local_vector` structures require real hardware.

---

## Development Workflow

What a developer does between making a change and getting it merged.

**1. Build the library with test/benchmark/sample clients:**

```bash
cd projects/rocalution
# -c → BUILD_CLIENTS_SAMPLES + TESTS + BENCHMARKS; -d fetches dependencies (incl. googletest)
./install.sh -dc
# host-only (no GPU), OpenMP on:            ./install.sh -c --host
# MPI multi-node build:                     ./install.sh -c --host --mpi=on --no-openmp
```

Test binary: `build/release/clients/staging/rocalution-test` (single monolithic GoogleTest binary).

**2. Run the tier that matches what you touched** (tiering is driven by environment variables, not
GTest name filters):

```bash
cd build/release/clients/staging
# smoke / quick:
ROCALUTION_EMULATION_SMOKE=1      HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 gpu-run ./rocalution-test
# pre-checkin / standard:
ROCALUTION_EMULATION_REGRESSION=1 HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 gpu-run ./rocalution-test
# a single solver:
./rocalution-test --gtest_filter='cg/parameterized_cg.cg_float/*'
# full sweep (no emulation var set):
./rocalution-test
```

> When any `ROCALUTION_EMULATION_*` var is set, GPU-heavy infrastructure suites (`local_matrix_*`,
> `local_vector`, `local_stencil`, `backend`, `preconditioner`, MPI infra) call `GTEST_SKIP()`, and
> solver suites shrink their parameter lists. If no emulation variables are set, the full set of parameter combinations is exercised.

**3. Add the right kind of test:** see [Choosing the Right Test Type](#choosing-the-right-test-type).

**4. Open the PR** targeting `develop`. A team member reviews and approves.

## Testing Strategy and Layers

### Unit Testing Strategy

**Purpose:** validate logic that can be exercised without a GPU — the **host backend** solver and
preconditioner algorithms, backend initialization/ordering, and the host implementations of the
`local_matrix` / `local_vector` structures.

Unlike GPU-bound math libraries, a large fraction of rocALUTION's logic is genuinely host-testable:
every solver and preconditioner has a host backend, so its algorithm can be run and validated on a
machine with no GPU (`./install.sh -c --host`). These cases live in the same `rocalution-test`
binary (there is no `clients/unittests/` split like rocSPARSE) and use a mix of GoogleTest styles:

* **Parameterized** (`INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P` + `TestWithParam<tuple>`): the solver/preconditioner
  suites (float and double as separate `TEST_P` cases, e.g. `cg_float`, `cg_double`).
* **Fixture** (`TEST_F`): structure tests such as `local_vector_test`, `local_matrix` ops.
* **Plain** (`TEST`): e.g., `backend_init_order.backend`.

There are no `TYPED_TEST` suites.

**Framework:** GoogleTest (`find_package(GTest REQUIRED)`). `main` at
`clients/tests/rocalution_host_gtest_main.cpp`, which calls `init_rocalution()` before
`RUN_ALL_TESTS()` and accepts `--device <id>` / `--version`.

**Location / naming:** `clients/tests/test_<component>.cpp` with implementation headers in
`clients/include/testing_<component>.hpp`. Shared helpers are in `clients/include/` (`utility.hpp`,
`random.*`, `common.hpp`, `validate.hpp`). There is no `clients/common/` directory — shared client
code is provided by rocm-cmake's `ROCMClients` module.

**How to run without a GPU:** build `--host` and run `./rocalution-test`; the host backend paths for
solvers and preconditioners execute on CPU.

**What is NOT covered as host unit tests:** the HIP backend kernels and the GPU-only structure
suites (`local_matrix_*`, `local_vector`, `local_stencil`), which are skipped under emulation tiers as they
require hardware.

**Coverage expectation:** the long-term ROCm-wide goal is >95% line coverage of hardware-independent
paths, pursued in phases. rocALUTION's host-backend coverage is meaningful because a large share of
the algorithm code runs on CPU; the GPU backend duplicates those algorithms in device code, which
host-side instrumentation does not capture. See [Coverage](#coverage).

---

### Integration Testing Strategy

**Purpose:** validate the HIP (and MPI) backends against the host reference — that each solver,
preconditioner, and structure operation produces correct results on-device, and that host–device
transfers and multi-node communication behave as expected.

**What is covered** (all as parameterized/fixture GoogleTest cases, per backend and per precision):

| Group | Examples |
|---|---|
| Krylov solvers | CG, CR, BiCGStab, BiCGStab(l), GMRES, FGMRES, FCG, IDR, QMRCGSTAB |
| Direct solvers | LU, QR, inversion |
| Algebraic multigrid | pairwise AMG, Ruge–Stüben AMG, smoothed-aggregation (SA-AMG), unsmoothed-aggregation (UA-AMG) |
| Preconditioners | Jacobi, GS/SGS, ILU/ILUT/IC, ItILU0, (AI)Chebyshev, FSAI, SPAI, TNS, AS/RAS, multi-colored GS/SGS/ILU, multi-elimination, variable |
| Structures (GPU) | `local_matrix` ops / conversions / multicoloring / itsolve / solve, `local_vector`, `local_stencil` |
| Other | Chebyshev iteration, mixed precision, iterative-solver integration (`test_itersolver`, coverage-only) |
| MPI (`SUPPORT_MPI`) | `global_matrix`, `global_vector`, `parallel_manager` |

**Tiers (environment-variable driven, mapped to CTest categories when built inside the monorepo with
`shared/ctest/`):**

| CTest category | Env var set | Labels | Timeout |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quick` | `ROCALUTION_EMULATION_SMOKE=1` | quick, pre-commit | 300 s |
| `standard` | `ROCALUTION_EMULATION_REGRESSION=1` | standard, pr | 1800 s |
| `comprehensive` | `ROCALUTION_EMULATION_EXTENDED=1` | comprehensive, nightly | 14400 s |
| `full` | *(none — full parameter sweep)* | full, weekly | 28800 s |
| `ffm-quick` / `ffm-full` | explicit filter `cg/parameterized_cg.cg_float/0` | ffm | 7200 s |

Unlike rocSPARSE/hipSPARSE, rocALUTION does **not** encode the tier in the GTest suite name — most
CTest suites use `test_patterns: ["*"]` and the subset is selected inside the binary by the emulation
env vars. The legacy `*checkin*` / `*nightly*` filters in `rtest.xml` and Jenkins do not match any
current test names.

**What requires GPU hardware:** the HIP-backend runs of every suite and the `local_*` structure
suites.

**What runs on CPU-only:** the host-backend runs (build `--host`).

**What requires MPI:** the
`global_*` and `parallel_manager` suites (`SUPPORT_MPI`).

**Managed-memory (HMM) cases:** on gfx90a, run with `HSA_XNACK=0` and `HSA_XNACK=1`.

**Test-size / coverage guidance:** solvers are validated on small representative systems (e.g.
Laplacian) across backends and both precisions; the emulation tiers shrink parameter lists rather than
running exhaustive size sweeps. The strategy prefers cross-backend correctness over large problem sizes.

---

### Performance and Benchmarking Testing

**Purpose:** detect regressions in solver/preconditioner performance on a given architecture. Absolute
numbers are not comparable across GFX targets.

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Stack layer | Expansion SDK (solver library) |
| Metrics measured | Solver iteration/solve time and convergence per solver × preconditioner × format |
| How benchmarks are run | `rocalution-bench` from `clients/staging/`; single-run by default, batch/sweep mode when `--bench-x` / `--bench-o` / `--bench-n` / `--bench-std` are given |
| Solvers / preconditioners | selectable via CLI (`--iterative_solver`, `--preconditioner`, `--direct_solver`, `--format`, tolerances, `--ndim`, `--matrix_filename`, …) |
| Baseline — stored per architecture | Not stored/aggregated in this repo (manual comparison); perf regression is tracked outside this repo. Must not be aggregated across GFX |
| Where results are stored | Benchmark output files (JSON/XML); `scripts/rocalution_bench_gnuplot_helper.py` renders histograms |
| Regression threshold | Not automated in this repo; perf regression is tracked outside this repo |
| Gating approach | Manual in-repo; perf regression tracked outside this repo |
| GPU profiling | Not integrated |

**Gating:**

| Gating Level | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Public CI (TheRock) automated gate | No | No perf gate in this repo's PR or nightly CI |
| Regression tracked outside this repo | Yes | Perf regression is tracked outside this repo |
| Manual review (in-repo) | Yes | On request via the bench + gnuplot helper |
| Release qualification | Partial | Reviewed before release; not an automated sign-off in this repo |

## Why rocALUTION is Tested This Way

rocALUTION implements the same solver and preconditioner algorithms across host, OpenMP, and HIP
backends. The cheapest, strongest signal is cross-backend agreement: run an algorithm on the host
reference and on the GPU and require they converge to the same answer. That is why a large share of
the suite is genuinely host-testable (build `--host`) while the GPU and `local_*` structure paths need
hardware.

Tiering is driven by environment variables (`ROCALUTION_EMULATION_*`) rather than GTest name prefixes
because the same test bodies serve every tier — the tier just shrinks parameter lists and skips the
GPU-heavy infrastructure suites. This keeps one set of test definitions honest across quick, standard,
and comprehensive runs, although the selected tier is not reflected in the test name (thus a readability gap).

---

## Pre-submit / CI Gates

The presubmit gate is the monorepo **TheRock CI** GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/therock-ci*.yml`), which runs on every pull request and push to `develop`
(`.github/scripts/therock_configure_ci.py`) and tests only changed projects
(`-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_ROCALUTION=ON` + sparse + rand). By default it runs the CTest **`standard`**
category, which sets `ROCALUTION_EMULATION_REGRESSION=1` — the regression subset in which GPU-heavy
infrastructure suites (`local_matrix_*`, `local_vector`, `local_stencil`, `backend`, MPI infra) skip
themselves and solver suites use reduced parameter sets. The other categories map to the emulation
vars: `quick` → `ROCALUTION_EMULATION_SMOKE=1`, `comprehensive` → `ROCALUTION_EMULATION_EXTENDED=1`,
`full` → complete parameter sweep (no emulation var). Scope widens per PR via labels
(`test:rocalution`, `test_type:comprehensive` / `test_type:full`); doc-only changes (`*.md`,
`docs/*`) skip CI.

Internal AMD **Jenkins** pipelines (`.jenkins/`) are legacy, running on older GPUs
(gfx900 / gfx906 / gfx908) via cron across three build variants — default (`./install.sh -c`,
HIP+OpenMP), host (`--host`), and MPI (`--host --mpi=on --no-openmp`).

> **Important nuance:** the Jenkins `runTestCommand` GTest filter is commented out, so those legacy
> lanes run the **full** `rocalution-test` suite (no emulation subset). The intended
> `*checkin*` / `*nightly*` filters match no current test names. The modern TheRock gate, by
> contrast, selects the subset through the `ROCALUTION_EMULATION_*` env var of the CTest category.

### Validation Gates and Ownership

| Validation Area | Required Before Merge | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build (HIP, host, static; MPI variant) | Yes | CI / DevOps | TheRock CI; Jenkins `precheckin`/`debug`/`staticlibrary` (legacy) |
| Unit / host-backend tests | Yes | Component team | In the CTest `standard` category (regression subset) |
| Integration tests | Yes | Component team | TheRock `standard` = regression subset (`ROCALUTION_EMULATION_REGRESSION=1`); legacy Jenkins runs the full suite (filter commented out) |
| Formatting | Yes | CI / DevOps | Repo-wide `pre-commit` |
| Static analysis | No (informational) | CI / DevOps | `clang-tidy`, `codeql`, Jenkins `staticanalysis.groovy` |
| Code coverage | No | Component team / CI | `codecov.groovy`, informational (Codecov, `rocALUTION`) |
| ASAN | Separate lane | CI / DevOps | TheRock ASAN workflows + `BUILD_ADDRESS_SANITIZER`; not a confirmed per-PR blocking gate |
| Shared validation infra | N/A | TheRock team | Shared build/validation infrastructure |
| Release qualification | N/A | Component team + QA + TPM | Readiness and known-gap review |

**Jenkins build variants:** default `./install.sh -c` (HIP + OpenMP); host `./install.sh -c --host`;
MPI `./install.sh -c --host --mpi=on --no-openmp`. Test path:
`build/release/clients/staging/rocalution-test`. On gfx90a, HMM tests run with `HSA_XNACK=0/1`.

### PR Test Classification

| Status | Applies to |
|---|---|
| Trusted gate | TheRock CI `standard` category (regression subset) on changed projects |
| Informational | Coverage upload (Codecov); TheRock nightly / comprehensive results; legacy Jenkins full-suite lanes |
| Unstable / flaky | No `known_bug` mechanism exists in rocALUTION today |

**Flaky / known-bug policy:** rocALUTION has **no `known_bugs.yaml`** and no tests use a `known_bug`
name; the `-*known_bug*` filter referenced in the Jenkins coverage job matches nothing. There is no
tracked quarantine list — this is a gap. A flaky test is not an acceptable permanent state; when one
appears it should be tagged and ticketed.

---

## Coverage

**Tool:** gcov/lcov. `-DBUILD_CODE_COVERAGE=ON` compiles with `-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage` and
links `--coverage -lgcov` (via `install.sh --codecoverage`, which also sets `BUILD_SUPPORT_COMPLEX=OFF`
and requires a Debug or RelWithDebInfo build).

**How to build and run:**

```bash
./install.sh -cg --codecoverage
cd build/debug
make coverage_cleanup coverage GTEST_FILTER='*'
# targets: coverage_analysis -> coverage_output (lcov capture + filter + genhtml -> lcoverage/) -> coverage
```

`ROCALUTION_CODE_COVERAGE=1` is set for the coverage run; it enables coverage-specific parameter sets
and is **required for `test_itersolver`** (skipped otherwise). lcov exclusions cover `src/utils/*`,
`src/base/host/host_io.*`, `clients/*`, `build/*`, `/opt/*`, `/usr/*`. Jenkins `codecov.groovy`
uploads `lcoverage/main_coverage.info`.

**Code coverage vs. test coverage**:
* *Code coverage* = fraction of lines executed by the suite.
* *Test coverage* = fraction of intended functionality exercised (solvers × preconditioners × formats
  × backends × precisions × MPI). Host-side gcov does not capture the HIP device kernels, so measured
  code coverage understates GPU-path work; disabling complex under coverage also narrows scope.

**Scope:** measured on Linux; Windows/complex coverage not tracked separately.

---

## Nightly Validation

Beyond PR validation, the intended nightly tier is `comprehensive`
(`ROCALUTION_EMULATION_EXTENDED=1`, timeout 4 h) with broader parameter sweeps, plus additional GPU
architectures. In practice the Jenkins `extended.groovy` lane runs the full suite because the tier
filter is not applied via test names (see the note under CI Gates). The `full` sweep (no emulation
var) is the weekly / release-scope run.

---

## Supported Configurations

Default GPU targets come from `GPU_TARGETS` in the root `CMakeLists.txt`.

| Configuration | Validation Level | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux + HIP backend | Full | PR / Nightly / Release | Primary platform |
| Linux host / OpenMP backend | Full | PR / Nightly | `--host`; CPU-only, no GPU required |
| Linux + MPI multi-node | Partial | Nightly | `--mpi=on`; `global_*` + `parallel_manager` suites |
| gfx908 / gfx90a / gfx942 / gfx950 | Full | PR / Nightly / Release | Core CDNA |
| gfx900 / gfx906 | Partial | PR / Nightly | Older GCN/CDNA |
| gfx103x / gfx110x / gfx1200 / gfx1201 | Partial | Nightly | RDNA |
| ASAN (gfx908/gfx90a/gfx942 `xnack+`) | Partial | On demand | AddressSanitizer, xnack+ only |

**Explicitly not tested / guaranteed:**

- Complex-number paths are disabled under coverage builds
- Non-listed gfx targets
- Windows coverage
- Global (MPI) stencil tests (`test_global_stencil.cpp` is
commented out).

---

## ASAN / TSAN / Sanitizer Coverage

**AddressSanitizer:** `-DBUILD_ADDRESS_SANITIZER=ON` (`install.sh --address-sanitizer`, forces
`amdclang++`) builds with `-fsanitize=address -shared-libasan`, links with `lld`, restricts GPU
targets to `gfx908:xnack+`, `gfx90a:xnack+`, `gfx942:xnack+`, and depends on `hip-runtime-amd-asan`.
It catches host and (xnack+) device memory errors.

**What is explicitly not covered:** TSAN, UBSAN, and MSAN are not wired into rocALUTION; non-xnack
device configurations are not ASAN-covered.

---

## Choosing the Right Test Type

| Scenario | What to add |
|---|---|
| New host-backend algorithm or fix (solver/preconditioner logic) | A parameterized host-backend case in `test_<component>.cpp`; runnable with `--host`, no GPU |
| New or changed GPU-backend behavior | A parameterized case exercised on the HIP backend, cross-checked against the host reference |
| New solver / preconditioner / AMG variant | A `test_<name>.cpp` with float and double `TEST_P` cases across backends; add matching sample if useful |
| New `local_matrix` / `local_vector` operation | A `TEST_F` structure case (GPU; skipped under emulation tiers) |
| MPI / multi-node change | A `global_*` or `parallel_manager` case (guarded by `SUPPORT_MPI`) |
| Bug fix | A regression case that fails before the fix |
| Performance-sensitive change | Run `rocalution-bench` before/after; render with `scripts/rocalution_bench_gnuplot_helper.py`; note the delta in the PR |

---
