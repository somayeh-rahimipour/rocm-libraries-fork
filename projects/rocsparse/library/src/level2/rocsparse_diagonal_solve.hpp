    // Reusable, format-agnostic diagonal backsolve for one or many right-hand sides:
    // Y = alpha * op(X) ./ D, where D is the diagonal of A seen as a sparse vector,
    // located through \p diag_ind (the per-row diagonal offset into A's shared val
    // array collected during the triangular-solve analysis, i.e.
    // rocsparse::trm_info_t::diag_ind). All of the solve semantics are folded in:
    // \p alpha scaling, the conjugation implied by a conjugate transpose \p trans
    // (conjugates d), the \p diagonal_mode (signed → /D, absolute → /|D|) and
    // numeric/structural zero-pivot reporting into \p zero_pivot.
    //
    // The RHS is a dense block of \p nrhs columns given by raw pointers and generic
    // strides: a plain vector is nrhs == 1 with a column stride of 0; a dense matrix
    // uses its leading dimension / order. \p conj_x conjugates the x entries on the
    // fly (conjugate-transpose RHS). One single launch covers all columns and batches.
    //
    // \p alpha must already be expressed in A's data type and point to host or device
    // memory according to the handle's pointer mode.
