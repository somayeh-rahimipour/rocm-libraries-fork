// Grid-extent clamps, one per axis. Each takes the handle and reads the limit
// from the device, so a caller never writes a bound itself. Any kernel launched
// with a clamped extent MUST grid-stride over the full count, e.g.
//
//     for(int64_t i = hipBlockIdx_x; i < count; i += hipGridDim_x)
//
// The axes are not symmetric because the limits are different quantities. On y
// and z the limit is a work-group count, and maxGridSize reports it. On x the
// limit is a work-item count, and no device property exposes it.
//
// The kernel dispatch packet stores all three grid extents as 32-bit counts of
// work-items rather than of work-groups [1][2]. On y and z that never binds:
// the per-axis work-group limit in maxGridSize[1] and [2] (65535) caps them at
// 65535 * 1024 work-items at most, far below 2^32. On x the device reports no
// usable work-group limit, so the work-item count is what binds: grid.x *
// blockDim.x must fit in 32 bits, and the largest grid.x that runs every block
// is (2^32 - 1) / blockDim.x:
//
//     blockDim.x       64      128      256      512     1024
//     max grid.x 67108863 33554431 16777215  8388607  4194303
//
// against the 2147483647 that maxGridSize[0] reports.
//
// get_grid_size_x clamps to the smaller of the derived bound and the reported
// extent: the derived bound because it is the one that binds, the reported one
// because it is the documented contract.
//
// [1] hsa_kernel_dispatch_packet_t in the HSA Runtime Programmer's Reference
//     Manual, shipped with ROCm as hsa/hsa.h, which documents grid_size_x as
//     the "X dimension of grid, in work-items".
// [2] https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html, "hidden_block_count_x", which
//     distinguishes the work-group count passed in the kernarg from the
//     dispatch packet value, "which has the grid size in work-items".
