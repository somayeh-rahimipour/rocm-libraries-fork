// Test-only helper shared by the large-grid unit tests (AISPARSE-699/700).
//
// The launches hardened by those tickets clamp grid.x with
// rocsparse::get_grid_size_x, to min(maxGridSize[0], (2^32 - 1) / blockDim.x)
// blocks, and grid-stride over whatever the clamp drops. For a 256-thread block
// that clamp is 16,777,215 blocks. The tests shrink maxGridSize[0] for speed
// rather than allocate a problem that large, and run a small problem through
// the same code path. This is the AISPARSE-702 idiom.
//
// A new header rather than an addition to unit_test_utils.hpp: that file is
// shared with the sibling unit-test branches, and a new leaf file cannot
// conflict with them.
//

// Internal handle definition: the complete _rocsparse_handle type is required to
// reach handle->properties.
#include "rocsparse_handle.hpp"
