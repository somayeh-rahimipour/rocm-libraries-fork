// Every convolution solver reachable through the Find solver lists in
// mlo_dir_conv.cpp must also be registered in the solver Id registry
// (solver.cpp). If a solver is dropped from the registry (e.g. by a revert) but
// left behind in a Find list, Find can still select it and MIOpen then throws
// miopenStatusInternalError from solver::Id::GetAlgo() because the id is
// unknown. This test fails fast on that drift instead of letting it ship and
// surface as a runtime crash in a workload.
