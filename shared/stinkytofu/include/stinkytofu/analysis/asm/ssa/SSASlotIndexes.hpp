// Program points for register allocation.
//
// Live intervals need a total order over the function with room to distinguish
// "reads its operands" from "writes its result" at the same instruction. Without
// that distinction a read-modify-write operand would look like two overlapping
// values and could never share a register, which would make even the legacy
// colouring fail verification.
//
// Each instruction therefore gets two consecutive indexes:
//
//   base + 0   use point   operands are read here
//   base + 1   def point   results are written here
//
// Every block also gets a leading pair whose def point is where block arguments
// are defined; a value live into the block starts at the block's first index.
// Indexes are assigned in block-list order, which is emission order, so a
// block's indexes are contiguous and adjacent blocks are numerically adjacent.
