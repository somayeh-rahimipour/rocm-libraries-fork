// Per-arch physical hardware facts, in one place, reachable from any pass via
// PassContext::getHWModel().
//
// SCOPE — facts, not policy. A value belongs here only if it describes what the
// silicon does: a queue depth, a fixed latency, a scoreboard size. Scheduling
// heuristics and tunable knobs do NOT belong here; they live in PassFeatureConfig
// (user-overridable, plumbed to both the Python bindings and stinkytofu-opt) or
// stay local to the pass that owns the policy. Two concrete examples of things
// deliberately kept out: InsertClusterBarrierPass's kRule3SignalLeadCycles ("set
// to 0 to co-locate the signal with the wait" — a placement policy) and the
// dsReadPerWmma / globalReadPerWmma scheduling ratios in CDNA5Config.
//
// This header is deliberately include-light: it is reachable from core headers,
// so it must not drag in the asm IR. HazardRule is therefore forward-declared and
// referenced by pointer; only HWModel.cpp includes the rule table itself.
