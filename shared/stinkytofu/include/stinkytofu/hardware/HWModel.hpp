// Per-arch physical hardware facts, in one place, reachable from any pass via
// PassContext::getHWModel().
//
// SCOPE — facts, not policy. A value belongs here only if it describes what the
// silicon does: a queue depth, a fixed latency, a scoreboard size. Scheduling
// heuristics and tunable knobs do NOT belong here; they live in
// PassFeatureConfig (user-overridable, plumbed to both the Python bindings and
// stinkytofu-opt) or stay local to the pass that owns the policy. Examples
// deliberately kept out include InsertClusterBarrierPass's configurable Rule 3
// signal lead and the dsReadPerWmma / globalReadPerWmma scheduling ratios in
// CDNA5Config.
//
// Per-opcode LDS drain caps / throughputs live on HwInstDesc (filled from each
// arch's *.Instructions.def via .dsMaxDrain / .dsThroughput). This header only
// keeps arch-level LDS queue facts and fallbacks for opcodes that omit those
// fields. It is deliberately include-light: HazardRule is forward-declared and
// referenced by pointer; only HWModel.cpp includes the rule table itself.
