/// non-empty memory-token set. Two consecutive legal groups may be fused only
/// when Layer2BarrierOverlapAnalysis contains the final-order-validated,
/// directional earlier-to-later pair, their token sets differ, and their
/// modeled cycle-distance is below the merge threshold
/// (PassFeatureConfig::DagFeatures::mergeBarrierThreshold, or the CDNA5 default
/// when unset): the earlier pair absorbs the later tokens and the redundant
/// second signal/wait pair is removed.
