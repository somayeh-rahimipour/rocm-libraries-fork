# CI Behavior Manipulation

TheRock CI is controlled by [`configure_ci.py`](../.github/scripts/therock_configure_ci.py), where it controls push, pull request, workflow dispatch and schedule CI behavior.

## Default behavior for push and pull request

TheRock CI will determine [Linux targets](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/blob/f4ddefcbc17bf36889295f4a97ee40ebcf1b7cdc/.github/workflows/therock-ci.yml#L94) and [Windows targets](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/blob/f4ddefcbc17bf36889295f4a97ee40ebcf1b7cdc/.github/workflows/therock-ci.yml#L107) and [file changes](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/blob/f4ddefcbc17bf36889295f4a97ee40ebcf1b7cdc/.github/scripts/therock_matrix.py#L7-L33), then run build and tests accordingly on file changes.

Example: a change made to `projects/rocfft` will only run `FFT` builds and tests.

For [CI changes](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/blob/f4ddefcbc17bf36889295f4a97ee40ebcf1b7cdc/.github/scripts/therock_configure_ci.py#L114-L121), we run all build and smoke tests.

## Pull request behavior

Here are additional labels that manipulate the CI behavior. The labels we provide are:

- `skip-therockci`: The CI will skip all builds and tests
- Label-gated cmake options: see [the section below](#label-gated-cmake-options) for the current list.

### Label-gated cmake options

A label can also turn on a cmake option for a single project's superbuild, so a branch can exercise a feature flag in CI without changing the default build for everyone else. The option is added only when the label is on the pull request *and* that project is already being built; it never applies to pushes to `develop`, nightly runs, or workflow dispatch.

These labels are declared in [`LABEL_GATED_CMAKE_OPTIONS`](../.github/scripts/therock_matrix.py) — one entry per label, naming the target project and the options to inject. The map is empty by default; adding an entry requires a code change plus a matching label in the repository's label set, since these labels are applied by hand and are not assigned by `labeler.yml`.

For example, this entry would make the label `ci:miopen-my-feature` build MIOpen with `-DMIOPEN_ENABLE_MY_FEATURE=ON`:

```python
LABEL_GATED_CMAKE_OPTIONS = {
    "ci:miopen-my-feature": {
        "project": "miopen",
        "cmake_options": ["-DMIOPEN_ENABLE_MY_FEATURE=ON"],
    },
}
```

`project` must name an entry in `project_map` or `additional_options` (for example `miopen`, `blas`, or `fft`) and `cmake_options` must be a list, even for a single option. Both are checked when the matrix is generated, so a typo fails the run with a clear message instead of quietly producing a build without the option. Whenever an entry is added, add its label to the bullet list above so the set of labels stays discoverable without reading the code.

The gated build replaces the normal one for that project rather than running alongside it, so there is no second job and no duplicate artifact — but it also means the flag-off configuration is not built while the label is applied.

The target project does not need a job of its own. Projects get merged together when they are built as a set — an optional component folds into its parent, and a dependency folds into the project that absorbs it — and the option follows its target onto whichever job ends up building it. Labelling `miopen` works whether the pull request touches `projects/miopen` directly or only `projects/hipdnn`. The option is applied last, so it beats a conflicting default that a merge brought in.

## Workflow dispatch behavior

For `workflow_dispatch`, you are able to trigger CI in [GitHub's therock-ci.yml workflow page](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/actions/workflows/therock-ci.yml). To trigger a workflow dispatch, click "Run workflow" and fill in the fields accordingly.
